Unsafe Undefined

 (require racket/unsafe/undefined) package: base ~

The bindings documented in this section are provided by the
racket/unsafe/undefined library, not racket/base or racket.

The constant unsafe-undefined is used internally as a placeholder value.
For example, it is used by letrec as a value for a variable that has not
yet been assigned a value.  Unlike the undefined value exported by
racket/undefined, however, the unsafe-undefined value should not leak as
the result of a safe expression. Expression results that potentially
produce unsafe-undefined can be guarded by check-not-unsafe-undefined,
so that an exception can be raised instead of producing an undefined
value.

The unsafe-undefined value is always eq? to itself.

Added in version 6.0.1.2 of package base.

unsafe-undefined : any/c ~

The unsafe “undefined” constant.

                                        *check-not-unsafe-undefined*
(check-not-unsafe-undefined v sym) ~
 -> (and/c any/c (not/c (one-of/c unsafe-undefined)))
  v : any/c ~
  sym : symbol? ~

Checks whether v is unsafe-undefined, and raises
exn:fail:contract:variable in that case with an error message along the
lines of “sym: undefined; use before initialization.”  If v is not
unsafe-undefined, then v is returned.

                                        *check-not-unsafe-undefined/assign*
(check-not-unsafe-undefined/assign v sym) ~
 -> (and/c any/c (not/c (one-of/c unsafe-undefined)))
  v : any/c ~
  sym : symbol? ~

The same as check-not-unsafe-undefined, except that the error message
(if any) is along the lines of “sym: undefined; assignment before
initialization.”

                                        *chaperone-struct-unsafe-undefined*
(chaperone-struct-unsafe-undefined v) -> any/c ~
  v : any/c ~

Chaperones v if it is a structure (as viewed through some inspector).
Every access of a field in the structure is checked to prevent returning
unsafe-undefined. Similarly, every assignment to a field in the
structure is checked (unless the check disabled as described below) to
prevent assignment of a field whose current value is unsafe-undefined.

When a field access would otherwise produce unsafe-undefined or when a
field assignment would replace unsafe-undefined, the exn:fail:contract
exception is raised.

The chaperone’s field-assignment check is disabled whenever
(continuation-mark-set-first #f prop:chaperone-unsafe-undefined) returns
unsafe-undefined. Thus, a field-initializing assignment—one that is
intended to replace the unsafe-undefined value of a field—should be
wrapped with (with-continuation-mark prop:chaperone-unsafe-undefined
unsafe-undefined ....).

prop:chaperone-unsafe-undefined : struct-type-property? ~

A structure type property that causes a structure type’s constructor to
produce a chaperone of an instance in the same way as
chaperone-struct-unsafe-undefined.

The property value should be a list of symbols used as field names, but
the list should be in reverse order of the structure’s fields. When a
field access or assignment would produce or replace unsafe-undefined,
the exn:fail:contract:variable exception is raised if a field name is
provided by the structure property’s value, otherwise the
exn:fail:contract exception is raised.
