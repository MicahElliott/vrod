Kernel Forms and Functions

 #lang racket/kernel package: base ~

The racket/kernel library is a cross-phase persistent module that
provides a minimal set of syntactic forms and functions.

“Minimal” means that racket/kernel includes only forms that are built
into the Racket compiler and only functions that are built into the
run-time system. Currently, the set of bindings is not especially small,
nor is it particularly well-defined, since the set of built-in functions
can change frequently. Use racket/kernel with care, and beware that its
use can create compatibility problems.

The racket/kernel module exports all of the bindings in the grammar of
fully expanded programs (see [missing]), but it provides #%plain-lambda
as lambda and λ, #%plain-app as #%app, and #%plain-module-begin as
#%module-begin. Aside from #%datum (which expands to quote),
racket/kernel provides no other syntactic bindings.

The racket/kernel module also exports many of the function bindings from
racket/base, and it exports a few other functions that are not exported
by racket/base because racket/base exports improved variants. The exact
set of function bindings exported by racket/kernel is unspecified and
subject to change across versions.

 (require racket/kernel/init) package: base ~

The racket/kernel/init library re-provides all of racket/kernel. It also
provides #%top-interaction, which makes racket/kernel/init useful with
the -I command-line flag for racket.
