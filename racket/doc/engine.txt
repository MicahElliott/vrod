Engines

 (require racket/engine) package: base ~

The bindings documented in this section are provided by the
racket/engine library, not racket/base or racket.

An engine is an abstraction that models processes that can be preempted
by a timer or other external trigger. They are inspired by the work of
Haynes and Friedman [Haynes84].

Engines log their behavior via a logger with the name 'racket/engine.
The logger is created when the module is instantiated and uses the
result of (current-logger) as its parent. The library adds logs a 'debug
level message: when engine-run is called, when the engine timeout
expires, and when the engine is stopped (either because it terminated or
it reached a safe point to stop). Each log message holds a value of the
struct:

  (struct engine-info (msec name) #:prefab) ~

where the msec field holds the result of (current-inexact-milliseconds)
at the moment of logging, and the name field holds the name of the
procedure passed to engine.

                                        *engine*
(engine proc) -> engine? ~
  proc : ((any/c . -> . void?) . -> . any/c) ~

Returns an engine object to encapsulate a thread that runs only when
allowed. The proc procedure should accept one argument, and proc is run
in the engine thread when engine-run is called. If engine-run returns
due to a timeout, then the engine thread is suspended until a future
call to engine-run. Thus, proc only executes during the dynamic extent
of a engine-run call.

The argument to proc is a procedure that takes a boolean, and it can be
used to disable suspends (in case proc has critical regions where it
should not be suspended). A true value passed to the procedure enables
suspends, and #f disables suspends. Initially, suspends are allowed.

                                        *engine?*
(engine? v) -> any ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is an engine produced by engine, #f otherwise.

                                        *engine-run*
(engine-run until engine) -> boolean? ~
  until : (or/c evt? real?) ~
  engine : engine? ~

Allows the thread associated with engine to execute for up as long as
until milliseconds (if until is a real number) or until is ready (if
until is an event). If engine’s procedure disables suspends, then the
engine can run arbitrarily long until it re-enables suspends.

The engine-run procedure returns #t if engine’s procedure completes (or
if it completed earlier), and the result is available via engine-result.
The engine-run procedure returns #f if engine’s procedure does not
complete before it is suspended after timeout-secs. If engine’s
procedure raises an exception, then it is re-raised by engine-run.

                                        *engine-result*
(engine-result engine) -> any ~
  engine : engine? ~

Returns the result for engine if it has completed with a value (as
opposed to an exception), #f otherwise.

                                        *engine-kill*
(engine-kill engine) -> void? ~
  engine : engine? ~

Forcibly terminates the thread associated with engine if it is still
running, leaving the engine result unchanged.
