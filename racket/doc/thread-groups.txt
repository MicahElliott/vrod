Thread Groups

A thread group is a collection of threads and other thread groups that
have equal claim to the CPU. By nesting thread groups and by creating
certain threads within certain groups, a programmer can control the
amount of CPU allocated to a set of threads. Every thread belongs to a
thread group, which is determined by the current-thread-group parameter
when the thread is created. Thread groups and custodians (see [missing])
are independent.

The root thread group receives all of the CPU that the operating system
gives Racket. Every thread or nested group in a particular thread group
receives equal allocation of the CPU (a portion of the group’s access),
although a thread may relinquish part of its allocation by sleeping or
synchronizing with other processes.

                                        *make-thread-group*
(make-thread-group [group]) -> thread-group? ~
  group : thread-group? = (current-thread-group) ~

Creates a new thread group that belongs to group.

                                        *thread-group?*
(thread-group? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a thread group value, #f otherwise.

                                        *current-thread-group*
(current-thread-group) -> thread-group? ~
(current-thread-group group) -> void?
  group : thread-group? ~

A parameter that determines the thread group for newly created threads.
