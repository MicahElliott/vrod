Custodians

See [missing] for basic information on the Racket custodian model.

                                        *custodian?*
(custodian? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a custodian value, #f otherwise.

                                        *make-custodian*
(make-custodian [cust]) -> custodian? ~
  cust : custodian? = (current-custodian) ~

Creates a new custodian that is subordinate to cust. When cust is
directed (via custodian-shutdown-all) to shut down all of its managed
values, the new subordinate custodian is automatically directed to shut
down its managed values as well.

                                        *custodian-shutdown-all*
(custodian-shutdown-all cust) -> void? ~
  cust : custodian? ~

In racket/gui/base, eventspaces managed by cust are also shut down.

Closes all file-stream ports, TCP ports, TCP listeners, and UDP sockets
that are managed by cust (and its subordinates), and empties all
custodian boxes associated with cust (and its subordinates). It also
removes cust (and its subordinates) as managers of all threads; when a
thread has no managers, it is killed (or suspended; see
thread/suspend-to-kill) If the current thread is to be killed, all other
shut-down actions take place before killing the thread.

                                        *current-custodian*
(current-custodian) -> custodian? ~
(current-custodian cust) -> void?
  cust : custodian? ~

Custodians also manage eventspaces from racket/gui/base.

A parameter that determines a custodian that assumes responsibility for
newly created threads, file-stream ports, TCP ports, TCP listeners, UDP
sockets, and byte converters.

                                        *custodian-managed-list*
(custodian-managed-list cust super) -> list? ~
  cust : custodian? ~
  super : custodian? ~

Returns a list of immediately managed objects (not including custodian
boxes) and subordinate custodians for cust, where cust is itself
subordinate to super (directly or indirectly). If cust is not strictly
subordinate to super, the exn:fail:contract exception is raised.

                                        *custodian-memory-accounting-available?*
(custodian-memory-accounting-available?) -> boolean? ~

Memory accounting is normally available in Racket 3m, which is the main
variant of Racket, and not normally available in Racket CGC.

Returns #t if Racket is compiled with support for per-custodian memory
accounting, #f otherwise.

                                        *custodian-require-memory*
(custodian-require-memory limit-cust      ~
                          need-amt       
                          stop-cust) -> void?
  limit-cust : custodian? ~
  need-amt : exact-nonnegative-integer? ~
  stop-cust : custodian? ~

Registers a required-memory check if Racket is compiled with support for
per-custodian memory accounting, otherwise the exn:fail:unsupported
exception is raised.

If a check is registered, and if Racket later reaches a state after
garbage collection (see [missing]) where allocating need-amt bytes
charged to limit-cust would fail or trigger some shutdown, then
stop-cust is shut down.

                                        *custodian-limit-memory*
(custodian-limit-memory  limit-cust       ~
                         limit-amt       
                        [stop-cust]) -> void?
  limit-cust : custodian? ~
  limit-amt : exact-nonnegative-integer? ~
  stop-cust : custodian? = limit-cust ~

Registers a limited-memory check if Racket is compiled with support for
per-custodian memory accounting, otherwise the exn:fail:unsupported
exception is raised.

If a check is registered, and if Racket later reaches a state after
garbage collection (see [missing]) where limit-cust owns more than
limit-amt bytes, then stop-cust is shut down.

A custodian’s limit is checked only after a garbage collection, except
that it may also be checked during certain large allocations that are
individually larger than the custodian’s limit. A single garbage
collection may shut down multiple custodians, even if shutting down only
one of the custodians would have reduced memory use for other
custodians.

For reliable shutdown, limit-amt for custodian-limit-memory must be much
lower than the total amount of memory available (minus the size of
memory that is potentially used and not charged to limit-cust).
Moreover, if individual allocations that are initially charged to
limit-cust can be arbitrarily large, then stop-cust must be the same as
limit-cust, so that excessively large immediate allocations can be
rejected with an exn:fail:out-of-memory exception.

                                        *make-custodian-box*
(make-custodian-box cust v) -> custodian-box? ~
  cust : custodian? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns a custodian box that contains v as long as cust has not been
shut down.

A custodian box is a synchronizable event (see [missing]). The custodian
box becomes ready when its custodian is shut down; the synchronization
result of a custodian box is the custodian box itself.

                                        *custodian-box?*
(custodian-box? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a custodian box produced by make-custodian-box, #f
otherwise.

                                        *custodian-box-value*
(custodian-box-value cb) -> any ~
  cb : custodian-box? ~

Returns the value in the given custodian box, or #f if the value has
been removed.
