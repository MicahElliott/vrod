Serialization

 (require racket/serialize) package: base ~

The bindings documented in this section are provided by the
racket/serialize library, not racket/base or racket.

                                        *serializable?*
(serializable? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v appears to be serializable, without checking the content
of compound values, and #f otherwise. See serialize for an enumeration
of serializable values.

                                        *serialize*
(serialize v) -> any ~
  v : serializable? ~

Returns a value that encapsulates the value v. This value includes only
readable values, so it can be written to a stream with write or
s-exp->fasl, later read from a stream using read or fasl->s-exp, and
then converted to a value like the original using deserialize.
Serialization followed by deserialization produces a value with the same
graph structure and mutability as the original value, but the serialized
value is a plain tree (i.e., no sharing).

The following kinds of values are serializable:

* structures created through serializable-struct or
  serializable-struct/versions, or more generally structures with the
  prop:serializable property (see prop:serializable for more
  information);

* prefab structures;

* instances of classes defined with define-serializable-class or
  define-serializable-class*;

* booleans, numbers, characters, interned symbols, unreadable symbols,
  strings, byte strings, paths (for a specific convention), #<void>, and
  the empty list;

* pairs, mutable pairs, vectors, flvectors, fxvectors, boxes, hash
  tables, and sets;

* date, date*, arity-at-least and srcloc structures; and

* module path index values.

Serialization succeeds for a compound value, such as a pair, only if all
content of the value is serializable.  If a value given to serialize is
not completely serializable, the exn:fail:contract exception is raised.

If v contains a cycle (i.e., a collection of objects that are all
reachable from each other), then v can be serialized only if the cycle
includes a mutable value, where a prefab structure counts as mutable
only if all of its fields are mutable.

The serialize and deserialize functions currently do not handle certain
cyclic values that read and write can handle, such as '#0=(#0#).

See deserialize for information on the format of serialized data.

                                        *deserialize*
(deserialize v) -> any ~
  v : any/c ~

Given a value v that was produced by serialize, produces a value like
the one given to serialize, including the same graph structure and
mutability.

A serialized representation v is a list of six or seven elements:

* An optional list '(1), '(2), or '(3) that represents the version of
  the serialization format. If the first element of a representation is
  not a list, then the version is 0. Version 1 adds support for mutable
  pairs, version 2 adds support for unreadable symbols, and version 3
  adds support for date* structures.

* A non-negative exact integer s-count that represents the number of
  distinct structure types represented in the serialized data.

* A list s-types of length s-count, where each element represents a
  structure type. Each structure type is encoded as a pair. The car of
  the pair is #f for a structure whose deserialization information is
  defined at the top level, otherwise it is a quoted module path or a
  byte string (to be converted into a platform-specific path using
  bytes->path) for a module that exports the structure’s deserialization
  information.  The cdr of the pair is the name of a binding (at the top
  level or exported from a module) for deserialization information,
  either a symbol or a string representing an unreadable symbol. These
  two are used with either namespace-variable-binding or dynamic-require
  to obtain deserialization information. See make-deserialize-info for
  more information on the binding’s value. See also
  deserialize-module-guard.

* A non-negative exact integer, g-count that represents the number of
  graph points contained in the following list.

* A list graph of length g-count, where each element  represents a
  serialized value to be referenced during the  construction of other
  serialized values. Each list element is  either a box or not:

  * A box represents a value that is part of a cycle, and for
    deserialization, it must be allocated with #f for each of its
    fields. The content of the box indicates the shape of the value:

    * a non-negative exact integer i for an instance of a structure type
      that is represented by the ith element of the s-types list;

    * 'c for a pair, which fails on deserialization (since pairs are
      immutable; this case does not appear in output generated by
      serialize);

    * 'm for a mutable pair;

    * 'b for a box;

    * a pair whose car is 'v and whose cdr is a non-negative exact
      integer s for a vector of length s;

    * a list whose first element is 'h and whose remaining elements are
      symbols that determine the hash-table type:

      * 'equal — (make-hash)

      * 'equal 'weak — (make-weak-hash)

      * 'weak — (make-weak-hasheq)

      * no symbols — (make-hasheq)

    * 'date* for a date* structure, which fails on deserialization
      (since dates are immutable; this case does not appear in output
      generated by serialize);

    * 'date for a date structure, which fails on deserialization (since
      dates are immutable; this case does not appear in output generated
      by serialize);

    * 'arity-at-least for an arity-at-least structure, which fails on
      deserialization (since arity-at-least are immutable; this case
      does not appear in output generated by serialize); or

    * 'mpi for a module path index, which fails on deserialization
      (since a module path index is immutable; this case does not appear
      in output generated by serialize).

    * 'srcloc for a srcloc structure, which fails on deserialization
      (since srclocs are immutable; this case does not appear in output
      generated by serialize).

    The #f-filled value will be updated with content specified by the
    fifth element of the serialization list v.

  * A non-box represents a serial value to be  constructed immediately,
    and it is one of the following:

    * a boolean, number, character, interned symbol, or empty list,
      representing itself.

    * a string, representing an immutable string.

    * a byte string, representing an immutable byte string.

    * a pair whose car is '? and whose cdr is a non-negative exact
      integer i; it represents the value constructed for the ith element
      of graph, where i is less than the position of this element within
      graph.

    * a pair whose car is a number i; it represents an instance of a
      structure type that is described by the ith element of the s-types
      list. The cdr of the pair is a list of serials representing
      arguments to be provided to the structure type’s deserializer.

    * a pair whose car is 'q and whose cdr is an immutable value; it
      represents the quoted value.

    * a pair whose car is 'f; it represents an instance of a prefab
      structure type. The cadr of the pair is a prefab structure type
      key, and the cddr is a list of serials representing the field
      values.

    * a pair whose car is 'void, representing #<void>.

    * a pair whose car is 'su and whose cdr is a character string; it
      represents an unreadable symbol.

    * a pair whose car is 'u and whose cdr is either a byte string or
      character string; it represents a mutable byte or character
      string.

    * a pair whose car is 'p and whose cdr is a byte string; it
      represents a path using the serializer’s path convention
      (deprecated in favor of 'p+).

    * a pair whose car is 'p+, whose cadr is a byte string, and whose
      cddr is one of the possible symbol results of
      system-path-convention-type; it represents a path using the
      specified convention.

    * a pair whose car is 'c and whose cdr is a pair of serials; it
      represents an immutable pair.

    * a pair whose car is 'c! and whose cdr is a pair of serials; it
      represents a pair (but formerly represented a mutable pair), and
      does not appear in output generated by serialize.

    * a pair whose car is 'm and whose cdr is a pair of serials; it
      represents a mutable pair.

    * a pair whose car is 'v and whose cdr is a list of serials; it
      represents an immutable vector.

    * a pair whose car is 'v! and whose cdr is a list of serials; it
      represents a mutable vector.

    * a pair whose car is 'vl and whose cdr is a list of serials; it
      represents a flvector.

    * a pair whose car is 'vx and whose cdr is a list of serials; it
      represents a fxvector.

    * a pair whose car is 'b and whose cdr is a serial; it represents an
      immutable box.

    * a pair whose car is 'b! and whose cdr is a serial; it represents a
      mutable box.

    * a pair whose car is 'h, whose cadr is either '! or '- (mutable or
      immutable, respectively), whose caddr is a list of symbols
      (containing 'equal, 'weak, both, or neither) that determines the
      hash table type, and whose cdddr is a list of pairs, where the car
      of each pair is a serial for a hash-table key and the cdr is a
      serial for the corresponding value.

    * a pair whose car is 'date* and whose cdr is a list of serials; it
      represents a date* structure.

    * a pair whose car is 'date and whose cdr is a list of serials; it
      represents a date structure.

    * a pair whose car is 'arity-at-least and whose cdr is a serial; it
      represents an arity-at-least structure.

    * a pair whose car is 'mpi and whose cdr is a pair; it represents a
      module path index that joins the paired values.

    * a pair whose car is 'srcloc and whose cdr is a list of serials; it
      represents a srcloc structure.

* A list of pairs, where the car of each pair is a non-negative exact
  integer i and the cdr is a serial (as defined in the previous bullet).
  Each element represents an update to an ith element of graph that was
  specified as a box, and the serial describes how to construct a new
  value with the same shape as specified by the box. The content of this
  new value must be transferred into the value created for the box in
  graph.

* A final serial (as defined in the two bullets back) representing the
  result of deserialize.

The result of deserialize shares no mutable values with the argument to
deserialize.

If a value provided to serialize is a simple tree (i.e., no sharing),
then the fourth and fifth elements in the serialized representation will
be empty.

                                        *serialized*
(serialized=? v1 v2) -> boolean? ~
  v1 : any/c ~
  v2 : any/c ~

Returns #t if v1 and v2 represent the same serialization information.

More precisely, it returns the same value that (equal? (deserialize v1)
(deserialize v2)) would return if

* all structure types whose deserializers are accessed with distinct
  module paths are actually distinct types;

* all structure types are transparent; and

* all structure instances contain only the constituent values recorded
  in each of v1 and v2.

                                        *deserialize-module-guard*
(deserialize-module-guard) ~
 -> (module-path? symbol? . -> . void?)
(deserialize-module-guard guard) -> void?
  guard : (module-path? symbol? . -> . void?) ~

A parameter whose value is called by deserialize before dynamically
loading a module via dynamic-require. The two arguments provided to the
procedure are the same as the arguments to be passed to dynamic-require.
The procedure can raise an exception to disallow the dynamic-require.

                                        *serializable-struct*
(serializable-struct id maybe-super (field ...) ~
                     struct-option ...)

Like struct, but instances of the structure type are serializable with
serialize.  This form is allowed only at the top level or in a module’s
top level (so that deserialization information can be found later).

Serialization only supports cycles involving the created structure type
when all fields are mutable (or when the cycle can be broken through
some other mutable value).

In addition to the bindings generated by struct, serializable-struct
binds deserialize-info:id-v0 to deserialization information.
Furthermore, in a module context, it automatically provides this binding
in a deserialize-info submodule using module+.

The serializable-struct form enables the construction of structure
instances from places where id is not accessible, since deserialization
must construct instances. Furthermore, serializable-struct provides
limited access to field mutation, but only for instances generated
through the deserialization information bound to deserialize-info:id-v0.
See make-deserialize-info for more information.

The -v0 suffix on the deserialization enables future versioning on the
structure type through serializable-struct/version.

When a supertype is supplied as maybe-super, compile-time information
bound to the supertype identifier must include all of the supertype’s
field accessors. If any field mutator is missing, the structure type
will be treated as immutable for the purposes of marshaling (so cycles
involving only instances of the structure type cannot be handled by the
deserializer).

Examples:
  > (serializable-struct point (x y))

  > (point-x (deserialize (serialize (point 1 2))))
  1

                                        *define-serializable-struct*
(define-serializable-struct id-maybe-super (field ...) ~
                             struct-option ...)

Like serializable-struct, but with the supertype syntax and default
constructor name of define-struct.

                                        *serializable-struct/versions*
(serializable-struct/versions id maybe-super vers (field ...) ~
                              (other-version-clause ...)
                              struct-option ...)
 
other-version-clause = (other-vers make-proc-expr
                                   cycle-make-proc-expr)

Like serializable-struct, but the generated deserializer binding is
deserialize-info:id-vvers. In addition, deserialize-info:id-vother-vers
is bound for each other-vers. The vers and each other-vers must be a
literal, exact, nonnegative integer.

Each make-proc-expr should produce a procedure, and the procedure should
accept as many argument as fields in the corresponding version of the
structure type, and it produce an instance of id. Each
cycle-make-proc-expr should produce a procedure of no arguments; this
procedure should return two values: an instance x of id (typically with
#f for all fields) and a procedure that accepts another instance of id
and copies its field values into x.

Examples:
  > (serializable-struct point (x y) #:mutable #:transparent) ~

  > (define ps (serialize (point 1 2)))

  > (deserialize ps)
  (point 1 2)
  > (define x (point 1 10))

  > (set-point-x! x x)

  > (define xs (serialize x))

  > (deserialize xs)
  #0=(point #0# 10)
  > (serializable-struct/versions point 1 (x y z)
       ([0
         ; Constructor for simple v0 instances: ~
         (lambda (x y) (point x y 0))
         ; Constructor for v0 instance in a cycle: ~
         (lambda ()
           (let ([p0 (point #f #f 0)])
             (values
               p0
               (lambda (p)
                 (set-point-x! p0 (point-x p))
                 (set-point-y! p0 (point-y p))))))])
       #:mutable #:transparent) ~

  > (deserialize (serialize (point 4 5 6)))
  (point 4 5 6)
  > (deserialize ps)
  (point 1 2 0)
  > (deserialize xs)
  #0=(point #0# 10 0)

                                        *define-serializable-struct/versions*
(define-serializable-struct/versions id-maybe-super vers (field ...) ~
                                     (other-version-clause ...)
                                     struct-option ...)

Like serializable-struct/versions, but with the supertype syntax and
default constructor name of define-struct.

                                        *make-deserialize-info*
(make-deserialize-info make cycle-make) -> any ~
  make : procedure? ~
  cycle-make : (-> (values any/c procedure?)) ~

Produces a deserialization information record to be used by deserialize.
This information is normally tied to a particular structure because the
structure has a prop:serializable property value that points to a
top-level variable or module-exported variable that is bound to
deserialization information.

The make procedure should accept as many arguments as the structure’s
serializer put into a vector; normally, this is the number of fields in
the structure. It should return an instance of the structure.

The cycle-make procedure should accept no arguments, and it should
return two values: a structure instance x (with dummy field values) and
an update procedure. The update procedure takes another structure
instance generated by the make, and it transfers the field values of
this instance into x.

prop:serializable : property? ~

This property identifies structures and structure types that are
serializable. The property value should be constructed with
make-serialize-info.

                                        *make-serialize-info*
(make-serialize-info to-vector           ~
                     deserialize-id     
                     can-cycle?         
                     dir)           -> any
  to-vector : (any/c . -> . vector?) ~
  deserialize-id : (or identifier? ~
                       symbol?
                       (cons/c symbol?
                               module-path-index?))
  can-cycle? : any/c ~
  dir : path-string? ~

Produces a value to be associated with a structure type through the
prop:serializable property. This value is used by serialize.

The to-vector procedure should accept a structure instance and produce a
vector for the instance’s content.

The deserialize-id value indicates a binding for deserialize
information, to either a module export or a top-level definition. It
must be one of the following:

* If deserialize-id is an identifier, and if (identifier-binding
  deserialize-id) produces a list, then the third element is used for
  the exporting module, otherwise the top-level is assumed. Before
  trying an exporting module directly, its deserialize-info submodule is
  tried; the module itself is tried if no deserialize-info submodule is
  available or if the export is not found. In either case, syntax-e is
  used to obtain the name of an exported identifier or top-level
  definition.

* If deserialize-id is a symbol, it indicates a top-level variable that
  is named by the symbol.

* If deserialize-id is a pair, the car must be a symbol to name an
  exported identifier, and the cdr must be a module path index to
  specify the exporting module.

See make-deserialize-info and deserialize for more information.

The can-cycle? argument should be false if instances should not be
serialized in such a way that deserialization requires creating a
structure instance with dummy field values and then updating the
instance later.

The dir argument should be a directory path that is used to resolve a
module reference for the binding of deserialize-id. This directory path
is used as a last resort when deserialize-id indicates a module that was
loaded through a relative path with respect to the top level. Usually,
it should be (or (current-load-relative-directory) (current-directory)).
