Channels

A channel both synchronizes a pair of threads and passes a value from
one to the other. Channels are synchronous; both the sender and the
receiver must block until the (atomic) transaction is complete. Multiple
senders and receivers can access a channel at once, but a single sender
and receiver is selected for each transaction.

Channel synchronization is fair: if a thread is blocked on a channel and
transaction opportunities for the channel occur infinitely often, then
the thread eventually participates in a transaction.

In addition to its use with channel-specific procedures, a channel can
be used as a synchronizable event (see [missing]).  A channel is ready
for synchronization when channel-get would not block; the channel’s
synchronization result is the same as the channel-get result.

For buffered asynchronous channels, see [missing].

                                        *channel?*
(channel? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a channel, #f otherwise.

                                        *make-channel*
(make-channel) -> channel? ~

Creates and returns a new channel. The channel can be used with
channel-get, with channel-try-get, or as a synchronizable event (see
[missing]) to receive a value through the channel. The channel can be
used with channel-put or through the result of channel-put-evt to send a
value through the channel.

                                        *channel-get*
(channel-get ch) -> any ~
  ch : channel? ~

Blocks until a sender is ready to provide a value through ch. The result
is the sent value.

                                        *channel-try-get*
(channel-try-get ch) -> any ~
  ch : channel? ~

Receives and returns a value from ch if a sender is immediately ready,
otherwise returns #f.

                                        *channel-put*
(channel-put ch v) -> void? ~
  ch : channel? ~
  v : any/c ~

Blocks until a receiver is ready to accept the value v through ch.

                                        *channel-put-evt*
(channel-put-evt ch v) -> channel-put-evt? ~
  ch : channel? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns a fresh synchronizable event for use with sync. The event is
ready for synchronization when (channel-put ch v) would not block, and
the event’s synchronization result is the event itself.

                                        *channel-put-evt?*
(channel-put-evt? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a channel-put event produced by channel-put-evt, #f
otherwise.
