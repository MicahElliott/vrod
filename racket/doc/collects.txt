Libraries and Collections

A library is module declaration for use by multiple programs. Racket
further groups libraries into collections. Typically, collections are
added via packages (see [missing]); the package manager works outside of
the Racket core, but it configures the core run-time system through
collection links files.

Libraries in collections are referenced through lib paths (see require)
or symbolic shorthands. For example, the following module uses the
"getinfo.rkt" library module from the "setup" collection, and the
"cards.rkt" library module from the "games" collection’s "cards"
subcollection:

  #lang racket
  (require (lib "setup/getinfo.rkt")
           (lib "games/cards/cards.rkt"))
  ....

This example is more compactly and more commonly written using symbolic
shorthands:

  #lang racket
  (require setup/getinfo
           games/cards/cards)
  ....

When an identifier id is used in a require form, it is converted to (lib
rel-string) where rel-string is the string form of id.

A rel-string in (lib rel-string) consists of one or more path elements
that name collections, and then a final path element that names a
library file; the path elements are separated by /. If rel-string
contains no /s, then /main.rkt is implicitly appended to the path. If
rel-string contains / but does not end with a file suffix, then .rkt is
implicitly appended to the path.

Libraries also can be distributed via PLaneT packages. Such libraries
are referenced through a planet module path (see require) and are
downloaded by Racket on demand, instead of referenced through
collections.

The translation of a planet or lib path to a module declaration is
determined by the module name resolver, as specified by the
current-module-name-resolver parameter.

1. Collection Search Configuration

For the default module name resolver, the search path for collections is
determined by the current-library-collection-links parameter and the
current-library-collection-paths parameter:

* The most primitive collection-based modules are located in "collects"
  directory relative to the Racket executable. Libraries for a
  collection are grouped within a directory whose name matches the
  collection name. The path to the "collects" directory is normally
  included in current-library-collection-paths.

* Collection-based libraries also can be installed other directories,
  perhaps user-specific, that are structured like the "collects"
  directory. Those additional directories can be included in the
  current-library-collection-paths parameter either dynamically, through
  command-line arguments to racket, or by setting the PLTCOLLECTS
  environment variable; see find-library-collection-paths.

* Collection links files provide a mapping from top-level collection
  names to directories, plus additional "collects"-like directories
  (that have subdirectories with names that match collection names).
  Each collection links file to be searched is referenced by the
  current-library-collection-links parameter; the parameter references
  the file, and not the file’s content, so that changes to the file can
  be detected and affect later module resolution. See also
  find-library-collection-links.

* The current-library-collection-links parameter’s value can also
  include hash tables that provide the same content as collection links
  files: a mapping from collection names in symbol form to a list of
  paths for the collection, or from #f to a list of "collects"-like
  paths.

* Finally, the current-library-collection-links parameter’s value
  includes #f to indicate the point in the search process at which the
  module-name resolver should check current-library-collection-paths
  relative to the files and hash tables in
  current-library-collection-links.

To resolve a module reference rel-string, the default module name
resolver searches collection links in current-library-collection-links
from first to last to locate the first directory that contains
rel-string, splicing a search through in
current-library-collection-paths where in
current-library-collection-links contains #f.  The filesystem tree for
each element in the link table and search path is effectively spliced
together with the filesystem trees of other path elements that
correspond to the same collection. Some Racket tools rely on unique
resolution of module path names, so an installation and configuration
should not allow multiple files to match the same collection and file
combination.

The value of the current-library-collection-links parameter is
initialized by the racket executable to the result of
(find-library-collection-links), and the value of the
current-library-collection-paths parameter is initialized to the result
of (find-library-collection-paths).

2. Collection Links

Collection links files are used by collection-file-path,
collection-path, and the default module name resolver to locate
collections before trying the (current-library-collection-paths) search
path. The collection links files to use are determined by the
current-library-collection-links parameter, which is initialized to the
result of find-library-collection-links.

A collection links file is read with default reader parameter settings
to obtain a list. Every element of the list must be a link specification
with one of the forms (list string path), (list string path regexp),
(list 'root path), (list 'root path regexp), (list 'static-root path),
(list 'static-root path regexp). A string names a top-level collection,
in which case path is a path that can be used as the collection’s path
(directly, as opposed to a subdirectory of path named by string). A
'root entry, in contrast, acts like an path in
(current-library-collection-paths).  A 'static-root entry is like a
'root entry, but where the immediate content of the directory is assumed
not to change unless the collection links file changes. If path is a
relative path, it is relative to the directory containing the collection
links file. If regexp is specified in a link, then the link is used only
if (regexp-match? regexp (version)) produces a true result.

A single top-level collection can have multiple links in a collection
links file, and any number of 'root entries can appear. The
corresponding paths are effectively spliced together, since the paths
are tried in order to locate a file or sub-collection.

The raco link command-link tool can display, install, and remove links
in a collection links file. See [missing] in [missing] for more
information.

3. Collection Paths and Parameters

                                        *find-library-collection-paths*
(find-library-collection-paths [pre-extras         ~
                                post-extras]) -> (listof path?)
  pre-extras : (listof path-string?) = null ~
  post-extras : (listof path-string?) = null ~

Produces a list of paths, which is normally used to initialize
current-library-collection-paths, as follows:

* The path produced by (build-path (find-system-path 'addon-dir)
  (get-installation-name) "collects") is the first element of the
  default collection path list, unless the value of the
  use-user-specific-search-paths parameter is #f.

* Extra directories provided in pre-extras are included next to the
  default collection path list, converted to complete paths relative to
  the executable.

* If the directory specified by (find-system-path 'collects-dir) is
  absolute, or if it is relative (to the executable) and it exists, then
  it is added to the end of the default collection path list.

* Extra directories provided in post-extras are included last in the
  default collection path list, converted to complete paths relative to
  the executable.

* If the PLTCOLLECTS environment variable is defined, it is combined
  with the default list using path-list-string->path-list, as long as
  the value of use-user-specific-search-paths is true. If it is not
  defined or if the value use-user-specific-search-paths is #f, the
  default collection path list (as constructed by the first three
  bullets above) is used directly.

  Note that on Unix and Mac OS X, paths are separated by :, and on
  Windows by ;.  Also, path-list-string->path-list splices the default
  paths at an empty path, for example, with many Unix shells you can set
  PLTCOLLECTS to ":‘pwd‘", "‘pwd‘:", or "‘pwd‘" to specify search the
  current directory after, before, or instead of the default paths,
  respectively.

                                        *find-library-collection-links*
(find-library-collection-links) ~
 -> (listof (or/c #f (and/c path? complete-path?)))

Produces a list of paths and #f, which is normally used to initialized
current-library-collection-links, as follows:

* The list starts with #f, which causes the default module name
  resolver, collection-file-path, and collection-path to try paths in
  current-library-collection-paths before collection links files.

* As long as the values of use-user-specific-search-paths and
  use-collection-link-paths are true, the second element in the result
  list is the path of the user–specific collection links file, which is
  (build-path (find-system-path 'addon-dir) (get-installation-name)
  "links.rktd").

* As long as the value of use-collection-link-paths is true, the rest of
  the list contains the result of get-links-search-files. Typically,
  that function produces a list with a single path, (build-path
  (find-config-dir) "links.rktd").

                                        *collection-file-path*
(collection-file-path  file                                 ~
                       collection ...+                     
                      [#:check-compiled? check-compiled?])  ~
 -> path?
  file : path-string? ~
  collection : path-string? ~
  check-compiled? : any/c = (regexp-match? #rx"[.]rkt$" file) ~
(collection-file-path  file                                    
                       collection ...+                         
                       #:fail fail-proc                         ~
                      [#:check-compiled? check-compiled?]) -> any ~
  file : path-string? ~
  collection : path-string? ~
  fail-proc : (string? . -> . any) ~
  check-compiled? : any/c = (regexp-match? #rx"[.]rkt$" file) ~

Returns the path to the file indicated by file in the collection
specified by the collections, where the second collection (if any) names
a sub-collection, and so on.  The search uses the values of
current-library-collection-links and current-library-collection-paths.

If file is not found, but file ends in ".rkt" and a file with the suffix
".ss" exists, then the directory of the ".ss" file is used. If file is
not found and the ".rkt"/".ss" conversion does not apply, but a
directory corresponding to the collections is found, then a path using
the first such directory is returned.

If check-compiled? is true, then the search also depends on
use-compiled-file-paths and current-compiled-file-roots; if file is not
found, then a compiled form of file with the suffix ".zo" is checked in
the same way as the default compiled-load handler.  If a compiled file
is found, the result from collection-file-path reports the location that
file itself would occupy (if it existed) for the found compiled file.

Finally, if the collection is not found, and if fail-proc is provided,
then fail-proc is applied to an error message (that does not start
"collection-file-path:" or otherwise claim a source), and its result is
the result of collection-file-path.  If fail-proc is not provided and
the collection is not found, then the exn:fail:filesystem exception is
raised.

Changed in version 6.0.1.12: Added the check-compiled? argument.

                                        *collection-path*
(collection-path collection ...+) -> path? ~
  collection : path-string? ~
(collection-path collection            
                 ...+                  
                 #:fail fail-proc) -> any ~
  collection : path-string? ~
  fail-proc : (string? . -> . any) ~

  NOTE: This function is deprecated; use collection-file-path, instead.
  Collection splicing implies that a given collection can have multiple
  paths, such as when multiple packages provide modules for a
  collection.

Like collection-file-path, but without a specified file name, so that a
directory indicated by collections is returned.

When multiple directories correspond to the collection, the first one
found in the search sequence (see Collection Search Configuration) is
returned.

                                        *current-library-collection-paths*
(current-library-collection-paths) ~
 -> (listof (and/c path? complete-path?))
(current-library-collection-paths paths) -> void?
  paths : (listof (and/c path-string? complete-path?)) ~

Parameter that determines a list of complete directory paths for finding
libraries (as referenced in require, for example) through the default
module name resolver and for finding paths through collection-path and
collection-file-path. See Collection Search Configuration for more
information.

                                        *current-library-collection-links*
(current-library-collection-links) ~
 -> (listof (or/c #f
                  (and/c path? complete-path?)
                  (hash/c (or/c (and/c symbol? module-path?) #f)
                          (listof (and/c path? complete-path?)))))
(current-library-collection-links paths) -> void?
  paths : (listof (or/c #f ~
                        (and/c path-string? complete-path?)
                        (hash/c (or/c (and/c symbol? module-path?) #f)
                                (listof (and/c path-string? complete-path?)))))

Parameter that determines collection links files, additional paths, and
the relative search order of current-library-collection-paths for
finding libraries (as referenced in require, for example) through the
default module name resolver and for finding paths through
collection-path and collection-file-path. See Collection Search
Configuration for more information.

                                        *use-user-specific-search-paths*
(use-user-specific-search-paths) -> boolean? ~
(use-user-specific-search-paths on?) -> void?
  on? : any/c ~

Parameter that determines whether user-specific paths, which are in the
directory produced by (find-system-path 'addon-dir), are included in
search paths for collections and other files. For example, the initial
value of find-library-collection-paths omits the user-specific
collection directory when this parameter’s value is #f.

If -U or --no-user-path argument to racket, then
use-user-specific-search-paths is initialized to #f.

                                        *use-collection-link-paths*
(use-collection-link-paths) -> boolean? ~
(use-collection-link-paths on?) -> void?
  on? : any/c ~

Parameter that determines whether collection links files are included in
the result of find-library-collection-links.

If this parameter’s value is #f on start-up, then collection links files
are effectively disabled permanently for the Racket process. In
particular, if an empty string is provided as the -X or --collects
argument to racket, then not only is current-library-collection-paths
initialized to the empty list, but use-collection-link-paths is
initialized to #f.
