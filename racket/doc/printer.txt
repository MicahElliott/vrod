The Printer

The Racket printer supports three modes:

* write mode prints core datatypes in such a way that using read on the
  output produces a value that is equal? to the printed value;

* display mode prints core datatypes in a more “end-user” style rather
  than “programmer” style; for example, a string displays as its content
  characters without surrounding "s or escapes;

* print mode by default—when print-as-expression is #t—prints most
  datatypes in such a way that evaluating the output as an expression
  produces a value that is equal? to the printed value; when
  print-as-expression is set to #f, then print mode is like write mode.

In print mode when print-as-expression is #t (as is the default), a
value prints at a quoting depth of either 0 (unquoted) or 1 (quoted).
The initial quoting depth is accepted as an optional argument by print,
and printing of some compound datatypes adjusts the print depth for
component values. For example, when a list is printed at quoting depth 0
and all of its elements are quotable, the list is printed with a '
prefix, and the list’s elements are printed at quoting depth 1.

When the print-graph parameter is set to #t, then the printer first
scans an object to detect cycles. The scan traverses the components of
pairs, mutable pairs, vectors, boxes (when print-box is #t), hash tables
(when print-hash-table is #t), fields of structures exposed by
struct->vector (when print-struct is #t), and fields of structures
exposed by printing when the structure’s type has the prop:custom-write
property. If print-graph is #t, then this information is used to print
sharing through graph definitions and references (see [missing]). If a
cycle is detected in the initial scan, then print-graph is effectively
set to #t automatically.

With the exception of displaying byte strings, printing is defined in
terms of Unicode characters; see [missing] for information on how a
character stream is written to a port’s underlying byte stream.

1. Printing Symbols

Symbols containing spaces or special characters write using escaping \
and quoting |s. When the read-case-sensitive parameter is set to #f,
then symbols containing uppercase characters also use escaping \ and
quoting |s. In addition, symbols are quoted with |s or leading \ when
they would otherwise print the same as a numerical constant or as a
delimited . (when read-accept-dot is #t).

When read-accept-bar-quote is #t, |s are used in printing when one | at
the beginning and one | at the end suffice to correctly print the
symbol. Otherwise, \s are always used to escape special characters,
instead of quoting them with |s.

When read-accept-bar-quote is #f, then | is not treated as a special
character. The following are always special characters:

   ( ) [ ] } } " , ' ` ; \

In addition, # is a special character when it appears at the beginning
of the symbol, and when it is not followed by %.

Symbols display without escaping or quoting special characters. That is,
the display form of a symbol is the same as the display form of
symbol->string applied to the symbol.

Symbols print the same as they write, unless print-as-expression is set
to #t (as is the default) and the current quoting depth is 0. In that
case, the symbol’s printed form is prefixed with '. For the purposes of
printing enclosing datatypes, a symbol is quotable.

2. Printing Numbers

A number prints the same way in write, display, and print modes. For the
purposes of printing enclosing datatypes, a number is quotable.

A complex number that is not a real number always prints as >m<+>n<i,
where >m< and >n< are the printed forms of its real and imaginary parts,
respectively.

An inexact real number prints with either a . decimal point, an e
exponent marker, or both.  The form is selected so that the output is as
short as possible, with the constraint that reading the printed form
back in produces an equal? number.

An exact 0 prints as 0.

A positive, exact integer prints as a sequence of decimal digits that
does not start with 0.

A positive, exact, real, non-integer number prints as >m</>n<, where >m<
and >n< are the printed forms of the number’s numerator and denominator
(as determined by numerator and denominator).

A negative exact number prints with a - prefix on the printed form of
the number’s exact negation.

3. Printing Extflonums

An extflonum prints the same way in write, display, and print modes. For
the purposes of printing enclosing datatypes, an extflonum is quotable.

An extflonum prints in the same way an inexact number, but always with a
t or T exponent marker. When extflonum operations are supported,
printing always uses t; when extflonum operations are not supported, an
extflonum prints the same as its reader (see [missing]) source, since
reading is the only way to produce an extflonum.

4. Printing Booleans

The boolean constant #t prints as #true or #t in all modes (display,
write, and print), depending on the value of print-boolean-long-form,
and the constant #f prints as #false or #f. For the purposes of printing
enclosing datatypes, a symbol is quotable.

5. Printing Pairs and Lists

In write and display modes, an empty list prints as (). A pair normally
prints starting with ( followed by the printed form of its car. The rest
of the printed form depends on the cdr:

* If the cdr is a pair or the empty list, then the printed form of the
  pair completes with the printed form of the cdr, except that the
  leading ( in the cdr’s printed form is omitted.

* Otherwise, the printed for of the pair continues with a space, .,
  another space, the printed form of the cdr, and a ).

If print-reader-abbreviations is set to #t, then pair printing in write
mode is adjusted in the case of a pair that starts a two-element list
whose first element is 'quote, 'quasiquote, 'unquote, 'unquote-splicing,
'syntax, 'quasisyntax, 'unsyntax, or 'unsyntax-splicing. In that case,
the pair is printed with the corresponding reader syntax: ', `, ,, ,@,
#', #`, #,, or #,@, respectively. After the reader syntax, the second
element of the list is printed. When the list is a tail of an enclosing
list, the tail is printed after a . in the enclosing list (after which
the reader abbreviations work), instead of including the tail as two
elements of the enclosing list.

The printed form of a pair is the same in both write and display modes,
except as the printed form of the pair’s car and cdr vary with the mode.
The print form is also the same if print-as-expression is #f or the
quoting depth is 1.

For print mode when print-as-expression is #t and the quoting depth is
0, then the empty list prints as '(). For a pair whose car and cdr are
quotable, the pair prints in write mode but with a ' prefix; the pair’s
content is printed with quoting depth 1. Otherwise, when the car or cdr
is not quotable, then pair prints with either cons (when the cdr is not
a pair), list (when the pair is a list), or list* (otherwise) after the
opening (, any . that would otherwise be printed is suppressed, and the
pair content is printed at quoting depth 0. In all cases, when
print-as-expression is #t for print mode, then the value of
print-reader-abbreviations is ignored and reader abbreviations are
always used for lists printed at quoting depth 1.

By default, mutable pairs (as created with mcons) print the same as
pairs for write and display, except that { and } are used instead of (
and ). Note that the reader treats {...} and (...) equivalently on
input, creating immutable pairs in both cases. Mutable pairs in print
mode with print-as-expression as #f or a quoting depth of 1 also use {
and }. In print mode with print-as-expression as #t and a quoting depth
of 0, a mutable pair prints as (mcons , the mcar and mcdr printed at
quoting depth 0 and separated by a space, and a closing ).

If the print-pair-curly-braces parameter is set to #t, then pairs print
using { and } when not using print mode with print-as-expression as #t
and a quoting depth of 0.  If the print-mpair-curly-braces parameter is
set to #f, then mutable pairs print using ( and ) in that mode.

For the purposes of printing enclosing datatypes, an empty list is
always quotable, a pair is quotable when its car and cdr are quotable,
and a mutable list is never quotable.

6. Printing Strings

All strings display as their literal character sequences.

The write or print form of a string starts with " and ends with another
". Between the "s, each character is represented. Each graphic or blank
character is represented as itself, with two exceptions: " is printed as
\", and \ is printed as \\. Each non-graphic, non-blank character
(according to char-graphic? and char-blank?) is printed using the escape
sequences described in [missing], using \a, \b, \t, \n, \v, \f, \r, or
\e if possible, otherwise using \u with four hexadecimal digits or \U
with eight hexadecimal digits (using the latter only if the character
value does not fit into four digits).

All byte strings display as their literal byte sequence; this byte
sequence may not be a valid UTF-8 encoding, so it may not correspond to
a sequence of characters.

The write or print form of a byte string starts with #" and ends with a
". Between the "s, each byte is written using the corresponding ASCII
decoding if the byte is between 0 and 127 and the character is graphic
or blank (according to char-graphic? and char-blank?). Otherwise, the
byte is written using \a, \b, \t, \n, \v, \f, \r, or \e if possible,
otherwise using \ followed by one to three octal digits (only as many as
necessary).

For the purposes of printing enclosing datatypes, a string or a byte
string is quotable.

7. Printing Vectors

In display mode, the printed form of a vector is # followed by the
printed form of vector->list applied to the vector. In write mode, the
printed form is the same, except that when the print-vector-length
parameter is #t, a decimal integer is printed after the #, and a
repeated last element is printed only once.

Vectors print the same as they write, unless print-as-expression is set
to #t and the current quoting depth is 0. In that case, if all of the
vector’s elements are quotable, then the vector’s printed form is
prefixed with ' and its elements printed with quoting depth 1. If its
elements are not all quotable, then the vector prints as (vector , the
elements at quoting depth 0, and a closing ). A vector is quotable when
all of its elements are quotable.

In write or display mode, an flvector prints like a vector, but with a
#fl prefix instead of #. A fxvector similarly prints with a #fx prefix
instead of #. The print-vector-length parameter affects flvector and
fxvector printing the same as vector printing. In print mode, flvectors
and fxvectors are not quotable, and they print like a vector at quoting
depth 0 using a (flvector  or (fxvector  prefix, respectively.

8. Printing Structures

When the print-struct parameter is set to #t, then the way that
structures print depends on details of the structure type for which the
structure is an instance:

* If the structure type is a prefab structure type, then it prints in
  write or display mode using #s( followed by the prefab structure type
  key, then the printed form of each field in the structure, and then ).

  In print mode when print-as-expression is set to #t and the current
  quoting depth is 0, if the structure’s content is all quotable, then
  the structure’s printed form is prefixed with ' and its content is
  printed with quoting depth 1. If any of its content is not quotable,
  then the structure type prints the same as a non-prefab structure
  type.

  An instance of a prefab structure type is quotable when all of its
  content is quotable.

* If the structure has a prop:custom-write property value, then the
  associated procedure is used to print the structure, unless the
  print-unreadable parameter is set to #f.

  For print mode, an instance of a structure type with a
  prop:custom-write property is treated as quotable if it has the
  prop:custom-print-quotable property with a value of 'always. If it has
  'maybe as the property value, then the structure is treated as
  quotable if its content is quotable, where the content is determined
  by the values recursively printed by the structure’s prop:custom-write
  procedure. Finally, if the structure has 'self as the property value,
  then it is treated as quotable.

  In print mode when print-as-expression is #t, the structure’s
  prop:custom-write procedure is called with either 0 or 1 as the
  quoting depth, normally depending on the structure’s
  prop:custom-print-quotable property value. If the property value is
  'always, the quoting depth is normally 1. If the property value is
  'maybe, then the quoting depth is 1 if the structure is quotable, or
  normally 0 otherwise. If the property value is 'self, then the quoting
  depth may be 0 or 1; it is normally 0 if the structure is not printed
  as a part of an enclosing quotable value, even though the structure is
  treated as quotable. Finally, if the property value is 'never, then
  the quoting depth is normally 0. The quoting depth can vary from its
  normal value if the structure is printed with an explicit quoting
  depth of 1.

* If the structure’s type is transparent or if any ancestor is
  transparent (i.e., struct? on the instance produces #t), then the
  structure prints as the vector produced by struct->vector in display
  mode, in write mode, or in print mode when print-as-expression is set
  to #f or when the quoting depth is 0.

  In print mode with print-as-expression as #t and a quoting depth of 0,
  the structure content is printed with a ( followed by the structure’s
  type name (as determined by object-name) in write mode; the remaining
  elements are printed at quoting depth 0 and separated by a space, and
  finally a closing ).

  A transparent structure type that is not a prefab structure type is
  never quotable.

* For any other structure type, the structure prints as an unreadable
  value; see Printing Unreadable Values for more information.

If the print-struct parameter is set to #f, then all structures without
a prop:custom-write property print as unreadable values (see Printing
Unreadable Values) and count as quotable.

9. Printing Hash Tables

When the print-hash-table parameter is set to #t, in write and display
modes, a hash table prints starting with #hash(, #hasheqv(, or #hasheq(
for a table using equal?, eqv?, or eq? key comparisons, respectively.
After the prefix, each key–value mapping is shown as (, the printed form
of a key, a space, ., a space, the printed form the corresponding value,
and ), with an additional space if the key–value pair is not the last to
be printed.  After all key–value pairs, the printed form completes with
).

In print mode when print-as-expression is #f or the quoting depth is 1,
the printed form is the same as for write. Otherwise, if the hash
table’s keys and values are all quotable, the table prints with a '
prefix, and the table’s key and values are printed at quoting depth 1.
If some key or value is not quotable, the hash table prints as (hash ,
(hasheqv , or (hasheq  followed by alternating keys and values printed
at quoting depth 1 and separated by spaces, and finally a closing ). A
hash table is quotable when all of its keys and values are quotable.

When the print-hash-table parameter is set to #f, a hash table prints as
#<hash> and counts as quotable.

10. Printing Boxes

When the print-box parameter is set to #t, a box prints as #& followed
by the printed form of its content in write, display, or print mode when
print-as-expression is #f or the quoting depth is 1.

In print mode when print-as-expression is #t and the quoting depth is 0,
a box prints with a ' prefix and its value is printed at quoting depth 1
when its content is quotable, otherwise the box prints a (box  followed
by the content at quoting depth 0 and a closing ). A box is quotable
when its content is quotable.

When the print-box parameter is set to #f, a box prints as #<box> and
counts as quotable.

11. Printing Characters

Characters with the special names described in [missing] write and print
using the same name.  (Some characters have multiple names; the
#\newline and #\nul names are used instead of #\linefeed and #\null.)
Other graphic characters (according to char-graphic?) write as #\
followed by the single character, and all others characters are written
in #\u notation with four digits or #\U notation with eight digits
(using the latter only if the character value does not fit in four
digits).

All characters display directly as themselves (i.e., a single
character).

For the purposes of printing enclosing datatypes, a character is
quotable.

12. Printing Keywords

Keywords write, print, and display the same as symbols (see Printing
Symbols) except with a leading #: (after any ' prefix added in print
mode), and without special handling for an initial # or when the printed
form would match a number or a delimited . (since #: distinguishes the
keyword).

For the purposes of printing enclosing datatypes, a keyword is quotable.

13. Printing Regular Expressions

Regexp values write, display, and print starting with #px (for
pregexp-based regexps) or #rx (for regexp-based regexps) followed by the
write form of the regexp’s source string or byte string.

For the purposes of printing enclosing datatypes, a regexp value is
quotable.

14. Printing Paths

Paths write and print as #<path:....>. A path displays the same as the
string produced by path->string. For the purposes of printing enclosing
datatypes, a path counts as quotable.

Although a path can be converted to a string with path->string or to a
byte string with path->bytes, neither is clearly the right choice for
printing a path and reading it back. If the path value is meant to be
moved among platforms, then a string is probably the right choice,
despite the potential for losing information when converting a path to a
string. For a path that is intended to be re-read on the same platform,
a byte string is probably the right choice, since it preserves
information in an unportable way. Paths do not print in a readable way
so that programmers are not misled into thinking that either choice is
always appropriate.

15. Printing Unreadable Values

For any value with no other printing specification, assuming that the
print-unreadable parameter is set to #t, the output form is
#<>something<>, where >something< is specific to the type of the value
and sometimes to the value itself. If print-unreadable is set to #f,
then attempting to print an unreadable value raises exn:fail.

For the purposes of printing enclosing datatypes, a value that prints
unreadably nevertheless counts as quotable.

16. Printing Compiled Code

Compiled code as produced by compile prints using #~. Compiled code
printed with #~ is essentially assembly code for Racket, and reading
such a form produces a compiled form when the read-accept-compiled
parameter is set to #t.

When a compiled form contains syntax object constants, they must not be
tainted or armed; the #~-marshaled form drops source-location
information and properties (see [missing]) for the syntax objects.

Compiled code parsed from #~ may contain references to unexported or
protected bindings from a module. At read time, such references are
associated with the current code inspector (see current-code-inspector),
and the code will only execute if that inspector controls the relevant
module invocation (see [missing]).

A compiled-form object may contain uninterned symbols (see [missing])
that were created by gensym or string->uninterned-symbol. When the
compiled object is read via #~, each uninterned symbol in the original
form is mapped to a new uninterned symbol, where multiple instances of a
single symbol are consistently mapped to the same new symbol. The
original and new symbols have the same printed representation.
Unreadable symbols, which are typically generated indirectly during
expansion and compilation, are saved and restored consistently through
#~.

The dynamic nature of uninterned symbols and their localization within
#~ can cause problems when gensym or string->uninterned-symbol is used
to construct an identifier for a top-level or module binding (depending
on how the identifier and its references are compiled). To avoid
problems, generate distinct identifiers either with generate-temporaries
or by applying the result of make-syntax-introducer to an existing
identifier; those functions lead to top-level and module variables with
unreadable symbolic names, and the names are deterministic as long as
expansion is otherwise deterministic.

Despite the problems inherent with uninterned symbols as variable names,
they are partially supported even across multiple #~s: When compiled
code contains a reference to a module-defined variable whose name is an
uninterned symbol, the relative position of the variable among the
module’s definitions is recorded, and the reference can be linked back
to the definition based on its position and the characters in its name.
This accommodation works only for variable references in compiled code;
it does not work for syntax-quoted identifiers, for example.

Finally, a compiled form may contain path literals. Although paths are
not normally printed in a way that can be read back in, path literals
can be written and read as part of compiled code. The
current-write-relative-directory parameter is used to convert the path
to a relative path as is it written, and then
current-load-relative-directory parameter is used to convert any
relative path back as it is read. The relative-path conversion applies
on reading whether the path was originally relative or not.
