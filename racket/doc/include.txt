File Inclusion

 (require racket/include) package: base ~

The bindings documented in this section are provided by the
racket/include and racket libraries, but not racket/base.

                                        *include*
(include path-spec) ~
 
path-spec = string
          | (file string)
          | (lib string ...+)

Inlines the syntax in the file designated by path-spec in place of the
include expression.

A path-spec resembles a subset of the mod-path forms for require, but it
specifies a file whose content need not be a module. That is, string
refers to a file using a platform-independent relative path, (file
string) refers to a file using platform-specific notation, and (lib
string ...) refers to a file within a collection.

If path-spec specifies a relative path, the path is resolved relative to
the source for the include expression, if that source is a complete path
string. If the source is not a complete path string, then path-spec is
resolved relative to (current-load-relative-directory) if it is not #f,
or relative to (current-directory) otherwise.

The included syntax is given the lexical context of the include
expression, while the included syntax’s source location refers to its
actual source.

                                        *include-at/relative-to*
(include-at/relative-to context source path-spec) ~

Like include, except that the lexical context of context is used for the
included syntax, and a relative path-spec is resolved with respect to
the source of source. The context and source elements are otherwise
discarded by expansion.

                                        *include/reader*
(include/reader path-spec reader-expr) ~

Like include, except that the procedure produced by the expression
reader-expr is used to read the included file, instead of read-syntax.

The reader-expr is evaluated at expansion time in the transformer
environment. Since it serves as a replacement for read-syntax, the
expression’s value should be a procedure that consumes two inputs—a
string representing the source and an input port—and produces a syntax
object or eof. The procedure will be called repeatedly until it produces
eof.

The syntax objects returned by the procedure should have source location
information, but usually no lexical context; any lexical context in the
syntax objects will be ignored.

                                        *include-at/relative-to/reader*
(include-at/relative-to/reader context source path-spec reader-expr) ~

Combines include-at/relative-to and include/reader.
