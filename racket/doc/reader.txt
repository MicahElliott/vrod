The Reader

Racket’s reader is a recursive-descent parser that can be configured
through a readtable and various other parameters. This section describes
the reader’s parsing when using the default readtable.

Reading from a stream produces one datum. If the result datum is a
compound value, then reading the datum typically requires the reader to
call itself recursively to read the component data.

The reader can be invoked in either of two modes: read mode, or
read-syntax mode. In read-syntax mode, the result is always a syntax
object that includes source-location and (initially empty) lexical
information wrapped around the sort of datum that read mode would
produce. In the case of pairs, vectors, and boxes, the content is also
wrapped recursively as a syntax object. Unless specified otherwise, this
section describes the reader’s behavior in read mode, and read-syntax
mode does the same modulo wrapping of the final result.

Reading is defined in terms of Unicode characters; see [missing] for
information on how a byte stream is converted to a character stream.

Symbols, keywords, strings, byte strings, regexps, characters, and
numbers produced by the reader in read-syntax mode are interned, which
means that such values in the result of read-syntax are always eq? when
they are equal? (whether from the same call or different calls to
read-syntax). Symbols and keywords are interned in both read and
read-syntax mode. Sending an interned value across a place channel does
not necessarily produce an interned value at the receiving place. See
also datum-intern-literal and datum->syntax.

1. Delimiters and Dispatch

Along with whitespace, the following characters are delimiters:

   ( ) [ ] { } " , ' ` ;

A delimited sequence that starts with any other character is typically
parsed as either a symbol, number, or extflonum, but a few non-delimiter
characters play special roles:

* # has a special meaning as an initial character in a delimited
  sequence; its meaning depends on the characters that follow; see
  below.

* | starts a subsequence of characters to be included verbatim in the
  delimited sequence (i.e., they are never treated as delimiters, and
  they are not case-folded when case-insensitivity is enabled); the
  subsequence is terminated by another |, and neither the initial nor
  terminating | is part of the subsequence.

* \ outside of a | pair causes the following character to be included
  verbatim in a delimited sequence.

More precisely, after skipping whitespace, the reader dispatches based
on the next character or characters in the input stream as follows:

2. Reading Symbols

+[missing] in [missing] introduces the syntax of symbols.

A sequence that does not start with a delimiter or # is parsed as either
a symbol, a number (see Reading Numbers), or a extflonum (see Reading
Extflonums), except that . by itself is never parsed as a symbol or
number (unless the read-accept-dot parameter is set to #f). A #% also
starts a symbol. The resulting symbol is interned. A successful number
or extflonum parse takes precedence over a symbol parse.

When the read-case-sensitive parameter is set to #f, characters in the
sequence that are not quoted by | or \ are first case-normalized. If the
reader encounters #ci, #CI, #Ci, or #cI, then it recursively reads the
following datum in case-insensitive mode. If the reader encounters #cs,
#CS, #Cs, or #cS, then it recursively reads the following datum in
case-sensitive mode.

Examples:
 Apple        reads equal to (string->symbol "Apple")
 Ap#ple       reads equal to (string->symbol "Ap#ple")
 Ap ple       reads equal to (string->symbol "Ap")
 Ap| |ple     reads equal to (string->symbol "Ap ple")
 Ap\ ple      reads equal to (string->symbol "Ap ple")
 #ci Apple    reads equal to (string->symbol "apple")
 #ci |A|pple  reads equal to (string->symbol "Apple")
 #ci \Apple   reads equal to (string->symbol "Apple")
 #ci#cs Apple reads equal to (string->symbol "Apple")
 #%Apple      reads equal to (string->symbol "#%Apple")

3. Reading Numbers

+[missing] in [missing] introduces the syntax of numbers.

A sequence that does not start with a delimiter is parsed as a number
when it matches the following grammar case-insensitively for >number10<
(decimal), where n is a meta-meta-variable in the grammar. The resulting
number is interned in read-syntax mode.

A number is optionally prefixed by an exactness specifier, #e (exact) or
#i (inexact), which specifies its parsing as an exact or inexact number;
see [missing] for information on number exactness. As the non-terminal
names suggest, a number that has no exactness specifier and matches only
>inexact-numbern< is normally parsed as an inexact number, otherwise it
is parsed as an exact number. If the read-decimal-as-inexact parameter
is set to #f, then all numbers without an exactness specifier are
instead parsed as exact.

If the reader encounters #b (binary), #o (octal), #d (decimal), or #x
(hexadecimal), it must be followed by a sequence that is terminated by a
delimiter or end-of-file, and that is either an extflonum (see Reading
Extflonums) or matches the >general-number2<, >general-number8<,
>general-number10<, or >general-number16< grammar, respectively.

A #e or #i followed immediately by #b, #o, #d, or #x is treated the same
as the reverse order: #b, #o, #d, or #x followed by #e or #i.

An >exponent-markn< in an inexact number serves both to specify an
exponent and to specify a numerical precision. If single-precision IEEE
floating point is supported (see [missing]), the marks f and s specify
single-precision. Otherwise, or with any other mark, double-precision
IEEE floating point is used. In addition, single- and double-precision
specials are distinct; specials with the .0 suffix, like +nan.0 are
double-precision, whereas specials with the .f suffix are
single-precision.

A # in an >inexactn< number is the same as 0, but # can be used to
suggest that the digit’s actual value is unknown.

 #e2e5      reads equal to 200000
 #x2e5      reads equal to 741
 #b101      reads equal to 5

4. Reading Extflonums

An extflonum has the same syntax as an >inexact-realn< that includes an
>exp-markn<, but with t or T in place of the >exp-markn<. In addition,
+inf.t, -inf.t, +nan.t, -nan.t are extflonums. A #b (binary), #o
(octal), #d (decimal), or #x (hexadecimal) radix specification can
prefix an extflonum, but #i or #e cannot, and a extflonum cannot be used
to form a complex number.  The read-decimal-as-inexact parameter has no
effect on extflonum reading.

5. Reading Booleans

A #true, #t, #T followed by a delimiter is the input syntax for the
boolean constant “true,” and #false, #f, or #F followed by a delimiter
is the complete input syntax for the boolean constant “false.”

6. Reading Pairs and Lists

When the reader encounters a (, [, or {, it starts parsing a pair or
list; see [missing] for information on pairs and lists.

To parse the pair or list, the reader recursively reads data until a
matching ), ], or } (respectively) is found, and it specially handles a
delimited ..  Pairs (), [], and {} are treated the same way, so the
remainder of this section simply uses “parentheses” to mean any of these
pair.

If the reader finds no delimited . among the elements between
parentheses, then it produces a list containing the results of the
recursive reads.

If the reader finds two data between the matching parentheses that are
separated by a delimited ., then it creates a pair. More generally, if
it finds two or more data where the last datum is preceded by a
delimited ., then it constructs nested pairs: the next-to-last element
is paired with the last, then the third-to-last datum is paired with
that pair, and so on.

If the reader finds three or more data between the matching parentheses,
and if a pair of delimited .s surrounds any other than the first and
last elements, the result is a list containing the element surrounded by
.s as the first element, followed by the others in the read order. This
convention supports a kind of infix notation at the reader level.

In read-syntax mode, the recursive reads for the pair/list elements are
themselves in read-syntax mode, so that the result is a list or pair of
syntax objects that is itself wrapped as a syntax object. If the reader
constructs nested pairs because the input included a single delimited .,
then only the innermost pair and outermost pair are wrapped as syntax
objects. Whether wrapping a pair or list, if the pair or list was formed
with [ and ], then a 'paren-shape property is attached to the result
with the value #\[; if the list or pair was formed with { and }, then a
'paren-shape property is attached to the result with the value #\{.

If a delimited . appears in any other configuration, then the
exn:fail:read exception is raised. Similarly, if the reader encounters a
), ], or } that does not end a list being parsed, then the exn:fail:read
exception is raised.

Examples:
 ()          reads equal to (list)
 (1 2 3)     reads equal to (list 1 2 3)
 {1 2 3}     reads equal to (list 1 2 3)
 [1 2 3]     reads equal to (list 1 2 3)
 (1 (2) 3)   reads equal to (list 1 (list 2) 3)
 (1 . 3)     reads equal to (cons 1 3)
 (1 . (3))   reads equal to (list 1 3)
 (1 . 2 . 3) reads equal to (list 2 1 3)

If the read-square-bracket-as-paren parameter is set to #f, then when
the reader encounters [ and ], the "exn:fail:read" exception is raised.
Similarly, if the read-curly-brace-as-paren parameter is set to #f, then
when the reader encounters { and }, the "exn:fail:read" exception is
raised.

If the read-accept-dot parameter is set to #f, then a delimited .
triggers an exn:fail:read exception. If the read-accept-infix-dot
parameter is set to #f, then multiple delimited .s trigger an
exn:fail:read exception, instead of the infix conversion.

7. Reading Strings

+[missing] in [missing] introduces the syntax of strings.

When the reader encounters ", it begins parsing characters to form a
string. The string continues until it is terminated by another " (that
is not escaped by \). The resulting string is interned in read-syntax
mode.

Within a string sequence, the following escape sequences are
recognized:

* \a: alarm (ASCII 7)

* \b: backspace (ASCII 8)

* \t: tab (ASCII 9)

* \n: linefeed (ASCII 10)

* \v: vertical tab (ASCII 11)

* \f: formfeed (ASCII 12)

* \r: return (ASCII 13)

* \e: escape (ASCII 27)

* \": double-quotes (without terminating the string)

* \': quote (i.e., the backslash has no effect)

* \\: backslash (i.e., the second is not an escaping backslash)

* \>digit8<{1,3}: Unicode for the octal number specified by digit8{1,3}
  (i.e., 1 to 3 >digit8<s), where each >digit8< is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
  or 7. A longer form takes precedence over a shorter form, and the
  resulting octal number must be between 0 and 255 decimal, otherwise
  the exn:fail:read exception is raised.

* \x>digit16<{1,2}: Unicode for the hexadecimal number specified by
  >digit16<{1,2}, where each >digit16< is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
  a, b, c, d, e, or f (case-insensitive). The longer form takes
  precedence over the shorter form.

* \u>digit16<{1,4}: like \x, but with up to four hexadecimal digits
  (longer sequences take precedence). The resulting hexadecimal number
  must be a valid argument to integer->char, otherwise the exn:fail:read
  exception is raised—unless the encoding continues with another \u to
  form a surrogate-style encoding.

* \u>digit16<{4,4}\u>digit16<{4,4}: like \u, but for two hexadecimal
  numbers, where the first is in the range #xD800 to #xDBFF and the
  second is in the range #xDC00 to #xDFFF; the resulting character is
  the one represented by the numbers as a UTF-16 surrogate pair.

* \U>digit16<{1,8}: like \x, but with up to eight hexadecimal digits
  (longer sequences take precedence). The resulting hexadecimal number
  must be a valid argument to integer->char, otherwise the exn:fail:read
  exception is raised.

* \>newline<: elided, where >newline< is either a linefeed, carriage
  return, or carriage return–linefeed combination. This convention
  allows single-line strings to span multiple lines in the source.

If the reader encounters any other use of a backslash in a string
constant, the exn:fail:read exception is raised.

+[missing] in [missing] introduces the syntax of byte strings.

A string constant preceded by # is parsed as a byte string. (That is, #"
starts a byte-string literal.) See [missing] for information on byte
strings. The resulting byte string is interned in read-syntax mode.
Byte-string constants support the same escape sequences as character
strings, except \u and \U. Otherwise, each character within the
byte-string quotes must have a Unicode code-point number in the range 0
to 255, which is used as the corresponding byte’s value; if a character
is not in that range, the exn:fail:read exception is raised.

When the reader encounters #<<, it starts parsing a here string. The
characters following #<< until a newline character define a terminator
for the string. The content of the string includes all characters
between the #<< line and a line whose only content is the specified
terminator. More precisely, the content of the string starts after a
newline following #<<, and it ends before a newline that is followed by
the terminator, where the terminator is itself followed by either a
newline or end-of-file. No escape sequences are recognized between the
starting and terminating lines; all characters are included in the
string (and terminator) literally. A return character is not treated as
a line separator in this context. If no characters appear between #<<
and a newline or end-of-file, or if an end-of-file is encountered before
a terminating line, the exn:fail:read exception is raised.

Examples:
 "Apple"     reads equal to "Apple"
 "\x41pple"  reads equal to "Apple"
 "\"Apple\"" reads equal to "\x22Apple\x22"
 "\\"        reads equal to "\x5C"
 #"Apple"    reads equal to (bytes 65 112 112 108 101)

8. Reading Quotes

When the reader encounters ', it recursively reads one datum and forms a
new list containing the symbol 'quote and the following datum. This
convention is mainly useful for reading Racket code, where 's can be
used as a shorthand for (quote s).

Several other sequences are recognized and transformed in a similar way.
Longer prefixes take precedence over short ones:

 '   adds quote
 `   adds quasiquote
 ,   adds unquote
 ,@  adds unquote-splicing
 #'  adds syntax
 #`  adds quasisyntax
 #,  adds unsyntax
 #,@ adds unsyntax-splicing

Examples:
 'apple  reads equal to (list 'quote 'apple)
 `(1 ,2) reads equal to (list 'quasiquote (list 1 (list 'unquote 2)))

The `, ,, and ,@ forms are disabled when the read-accept-quasiquote
parameter is set to #f, in which case the exn:fail:read exception is
raised instead.

9. Reading Comments

A ; starts a line comment. When the reader encounters ;, it skips past
all characters until the next linefeed (ASCII 10), carriage return
(ASCII 13), next-line (Unicode 133), line-separator (Unicode 8232), or
paragraph-separator (Unicode 8233) character.

A #| starts a nestable block comment.  When the reader encounters #|, it
skips past all characters until a closing |#. Pairs of matching #| and
|# can be nested.

A #; starts an S-expression comment. When the reader encounters #;, it
recursively reads one datum, and then discards it (continuing on to the
next datum for the read result).

A #!  (which is #! followed by a space) or #!/ starts a line comment
that can be continued to the next line by ending a line with \. This
form of comment normally appears at the beginning of a Unix script file.

Examples:
 ; comment         reads equal to nothing
 #| a |# 1         reads equal to 1
 #| #| a |# 1 |# 2 reads equal to 2
 #;1 2             reads equal to 2
 #!/bin/sh         reads equal to nothing
 #! /bin/sh        reads equal to nothing

10. Reading Vectors

When the reader encounters a #(, #[, or #{, it starts parsing a vector;
see [missing] for information on vectors. A #fl in place of # starts an
flvector, but is not allowed in read-syntax mode; see [missing] for
information on flvectors. A #fx in place of # starts an fxvector, but is
not allowed in read-syntax mode; see [missing] for information on
fxvectors. The #[, #{, #fl[, #fl{, #fx[, and #fx{ forms can be disabled
through the read-square-bracket-as-paren and read-curly-brace-as-paren
parameters.

The elements of the vector are recursively read until a matching ), ],
or } is found, just as for lists (see Reading Pairs and Lists). A
delimited . is not allowed among the vector elements. In the case of
flvectors, the recursive read for element is implicitly prefixed with #i
and must produce a flonum. In the case of flvectors, the recursive read
for element is implicitly prefixed with #e and must produce a fixnum.

An optional vector length can be specified between #, #fl, #fx  and (,
[, or {. The size is specified using a sequence of decimal digits, and
the number of elements provided for the vector must be no more than the
specified size. If fewer elements are provided, the last provided
element is used for the remaining vector slots; if no elements are
provided, then 0 is used for all slots.

In read-syntax mode, each recursive read for vector elements is also in
read-syntax mode, so that the wrapped vector’s elements are also wrapped
as syntax objects, and the vector is immutable.

Examples:
 #(1 apple 3)         reads equal to (vector 1 'apple 3)
 #3("apple" "banana") reads equal to (vector "apple" "banana" "banana")
 #3()                 reads equal to (vector 0 0 0)

11. Reading Structures

When the reader encounters a #s(, #s[, or #s{, it starts parsing an
instance of a prefab structure type; see [missing] for information on
structure types.  The #s[ and #s{ forms can be disabled through the
read-square-bracket-as-paren and read-curly-brace-as-paren parameters.

The elements of the structure are recursively read until a matching ),
], or } is found, just as for lists (see Reading Pairs and Lists). A
single delimited . is not allowed among the elements, but two .s can be
used as in a list for an infix conversion.

The first element is used as the structure descriptor, and it must have
the form (when quoted) of a possible argument to make-prefab-struct; in
the simplest case, it can be a symbol. The remaining elements correspond
to field values within the structure.

In read-syntax mode, the structure type must not have any mutable
fields. The structure’s elements are read in read-syntax mode, so that
the wrapped structure’s elements are also wrapped as syntax objects.

If the first structure element is not a valid prefab structure type key,
or if the number of provided fields is inconsistent with the indicated
prefab structure type, the exn:fail:read exception is raised.

12. Reading Hash Tables

A #hash starts an immutable hash-table constant with key matching based
on equal?. The characters after hash must parse as a list of pairs (see
Reading Pairs and Lists) with a specific use of delimited .: it must
appear between the elements of each pair in the list and nowhere in the
sequence of list elements. The first element of each pair is used as the
key for a table entry, and the second element of each pair is the
associated value.

A #hasheq starts a hash table like #hash, except that it constructs a
hash table based on eq? instead of equal?.

A #hasheqv starts a hash table like #hash, except that it constructs a
hash table based on eqv? instead of equal?.

In all cases, the table is constructed by adding each mapping to the
hash table from left to right, so later mappings can hide earlier
mappings if the keys are equivalent.

Examples, where make-... stands for make-immutable-hash:
 #hash()                  reads equal to (make-... '())
 #hasheq()                reads equal to (make-...eq '())
 #hash(("a" . 5))         reads equal to (make-... '(("a" . 5)))
 #hasheq((a . 5) (b . 7)) reads equal to (make-...eq '((b . 7) (a . 5)))
 #hasheq((a . 5) (a . 7)) reads equal to (make-...eq '((a . 7)))

13. Reading Boxes

When the reader encounters a #&, it starts parsing a box; see [missing]
for information on boxes. The content of the box is determined by
recursively reading the next datum.

In read-syntax mode, the recursive read for the box content is also in
read-syntax mode, so that the wrapped box’s content is also wrapped as a
syntax object, and the box is immutable.

Examples:
 #&17 reads equal to (box 17)

14. Reading Characters

+[missing] in [missing] introduces the syntax of characters.

A #\ starts a character constant, which has one of the following forms:

* #\nul or #\null: NUL (ASCII 0); the next character must not be
  alphabetic.

* #\backspace: backspace  (ASCII 8); the next character must not be
  alphabetic.

* #\tab: tab (ASCII 9); the next character must not be alphabetic.

* #\newline or #\linefeed: linefeed (ASCII 10); the next character must
  not be alphabetic.

* #\vtab: vertical tab (ASCII 11); the next character must not be
  alphabetic.

* #\page: page break (ASCII 12); the next character must not be
  alphabetic.

* #\return: carriage return (ASCII 13); the next character must not be
  alphabetic.

* #\space: space (ASCII 32); the next character must not be alphabetic.

* #\rubout: delete (ASCII 127); the next character must not be
  alphabetic.

* #\>digit8<{3,3}: Unicode for the octal number specified by three octal
  digits—as in string escapes (see Reading Strings), but constrained to
  exactly three digits.

* #\u>digit16<{1,4}: Unicode for the hexadecimal number specified by
  >digit16<{1,4}, as in string escapes (see Reading Strings).

* #\U>digit16<{1,6}: like #\u, but with up to six hexadecimal digits.

* #\>c<: the character >c<, as long as #\>c< and the characters
  following it do not match any of the previous cases, and as long as
  the character after >c< is not alphabetic.

Examples:
 #\newline reads equal to (integer->char 10)
 #\n       reads equal to (integer->char 110)
 #\u3BB    reads equal to (integer->char 955)
 #\λ       reads equal to (integer->char 955)

15. Reading Keywords

A #: starts a keyword. The parsing of a keyword after the #: is the same
as for a symbol, including case-folding in case-insensitive mode, except
that the part after #: is never parsed as a number. The resulting
keyword is interned.

Examples:
 #:Apple reads equal to (string->keyword "Apple") ~
 #:1     reads equal to (string->keyword "1") ~

16. Reading Regular Expressions

A #rx or #px starts a regular expression. The characters immediately
after #rx or #px must parse as a string or byte string (see Reading
Strings). A #rx prefix starts a regular expression as would be
constructed by regexp, #px as constructed by pregexp, #rx# as
constructed by byte-regexp, and #px# as constructed by byte-pregexp. The
resulting regular expression is interned in read-syntax mode.

Examples:
 #rx".*"      reads equal to (regexp ".*")
 #px"[\\s]*"  reads equal to (pregexp "[\\s]*")
 #rx#".*"     reads equal to (byte-regexp #".*")
 #px#"[\\s]*" reads equal to (byte-pregexp #"[\\s]*")

17. Reading Graph Structure

A #>digit10<{1,8}= tags the following datum for reference via
#>digit10<{1,8}#, which allows the reader to produce a datum that has
graph structure.

For a specific >digit10<{1,8} in a single read result, each
#>digit10<{1,8}# reference is replaced by the datum read for the
corresponding #>digit10<{1,8}=; the definition #>digit10<{1,8}= also
produces just the datum after it. A #>digit10<{1,8}= definition can
appear at most once, and a #>digit10<{1,8}= definition must appear
before a #>digit10<{1,8}# reference appears, otherwise the exn:fail:read
exception is raised. If the read-accept-graph parameter is set to #f,
then #>digit10<{1,8}= or #>digit10<{1,8}# triggers a exn:fail:read
exception.

Although a comment parsed via #; discards the datum afterward,
#>digit10<{1,8}= definitions in the discarded datum still can be
referenced by other parts of the reader input, as long as both the
comment and the reference are grouped together by some other form (i.e.,
some recursive read); a top-level #; comment neither defines nor uses
graph tags for other top-level forms.

Examples:
 (#1=100 #1# #1#) reads equal to (list 100 100 100)
 #0=(1 . #0#)     reads equal to (let* ([ph (make-placeholder #f)]
                                        [v (cons 1 ph)])
                                   (placeholder-set! ph v)
                                   (make-reader-graph v))


18. Reading via an Extension

+[missing] in [missing] introduces reader extension.

When the reader encounters #reader, it loads an external reader
procedure and applies it to the current input stream.

The reader recursively reads the next datum after #reader, and passes it
to the procedure that is the value of the current-reader-guard
parameter; the result is used as a module path. The module path is
passed to dynamic-require with either 'read or 'read-syntax (depending
on whether the reader is in read or read-syntax mode).

The arity of the resulting procedure determines whether it accepts extra
source-location information: a read procedure accepts either one
argument (an input port) or five, and a read-syntax procedure accepts
either two arguments (a name value and an input port) or six. In either
case, the four optional arguments are the reader’s module path (as a
syntax object in read-syntax mode) followed by the line (positive exact
integer or #f), column (non-negative exact integer or #f), and position
(positive exact integer or #f) of the start of the #reader form. The
input port is the one whose stream contained #reader, where the stream
position is immediately after the recursively read module path.

The procedure should produce a datum result.  If the result is a syntax
object in read mode, then it is converted to a datum using
syntax->datum; if the result is not a syntax object in read-syntax mode,
then it is converted to one using datum->syntax. See also [missing] for
information on the procedure’s results.

If the read-accept-reader parameter is set to #f, then if the reader
encounters #reader, the exn:fail:read exception is raised.

+[missing] in [missing] introduces #lang.

The #lang reader form is similar to #reader, but more constrained: the
#lang must be followed by a single space (ASCII 32), and then a
non-empty sequence of alphanumeric ASCII, +, -, _, and/or / characters
terminated by whitespace or an end-of-file.  The sequence must not start
or end with /. A sequence #lang >name< is equivalent to either #reader
(submod >name< reader) or #reader >name</lang/reader, where the former
is tried first guarded by a module-declared? check (but after filtering
by current-reader-guard, so both are passed to the value of
current-reader-guard if the latter is used). Note that the terminating
whitespace (if any) is not consumed before the external reading
procedure is called.

+[missing] in [missing] introduces the creation languages for #lang.

Finally, #! is an alias for #lang followed by a space when #! is
followed by alphanumeric ASCII, +, -, or _. Use of this alias is
discouraged except as needed to construct programs that conform to
certain grammars, such as that of R6RS [Sperber07].

The syntax/module-reader library provides a domain-specific language for
writing language readers.

By convention, #lang normally appears at the beginning of a file,
possibly after comment forms, to specify the syntax of a module.

If the read-accept-reader or read-accept-lang parameter is set to #f,
then if the reader encounters #lang or equivalent #!, the exn:fail:read
exception is raised.

18.1. S-Expression Reader Language

 #lang s-exp package: base ~

+[missing] in [missing] introduces the s-exp meta-language.

The s-exp “language” is a kind of meta-language. It reads the
S-expression that follows #lang s-exp and uses it as the language of a
module form. It also reads all remaining S-expressions until an
end-of-file, using them for the body of the generated module.

That is,

  #lang s-exp module-path
  form ...

is equivalent to

  (module name-id module-path
    form ...)

where name-id is derived from the source input port’s name: if the port
name is a filename path, the filename without its directory path and
extension is used for name-id, otherwise name-id is anonymous-module.

18.2. Chaining Reader Language

 #lang reader package: base ~

+[missing] in [missing] introduces the reader meta-language.

The reader “language” is a kind of meta-language. It reads the
S-expression that follows #lang reader and uses it as a module path
(relative to the module being read) that effectively takes the place of
reader. In other words, the reader meta-language generalizes the syntax
of the module specified after #lang to be a module path, and without the
implicit addition of /lang/reader to the path.
