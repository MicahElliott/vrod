Structure Inspectors

An inspector provides access to structure fields and structure type
information without the normal field accessors and mutators. (Inspectors
are also used to control access to module bindings; see [missing].)
Inspectors are primarily intended for use by debuggers.

When a structure type is created, an inspector can be supplied. The
given inspector is not the one that will control the new structure type;
instead, the given inspector’s parent will control the type. By using
the parent of the given inspector, the structure type remains opaque to
“peer” code that cannot access the parent inspector.

The current-inspector parameter determines a default inspector argument
for new structure types. An alternate inspector can be provided though
the #:inspector option of the define-struct form (see [missing]), or
through an optional inspector argument to make-struct-type.

                                        *inspector?*
(inspector? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is an inspector, #f otherwise.

                                        *make-inspector*
(make-inspector [inspector]) -> inspector? ~
  inspector : inspector? = (current-inspector) ~

Returns a new inspector that is a subinspector of inspector. Any
structure type controlled by the new inspector is also controlled by its
ancestor inspectors, but no other inspectors.

                                        *make-sibling-inspector*
(make-sibling-inspector [inspector]) -> inspector? ~
  inspector : inspector? = (current-inspector) ~

Returns a new inspector that is a subinspector of the same inspector as
inspector. That is, inspector and the result inspector control mutually
disjoint sets of structure types.

                                        *current-inspector*
(current-inspector) -> inspector? ~
(current-inspector insp) -> void?
  insp : inspector? ~

A parameter that determines the default inspector for newly created
structure types.

                                        *struct-info*
(struct-info v) -> (or/c struct-type? #f) boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns two values:

* struct-type: a structure type descriptor or #f; the result is a
  structure type descriptor of the most specific type for which v is an
  instance, and for which the current inspector has control, or the
  result is #f if the current inspector does not control any structure
  type for which the struct is an instance.

* skipped?: #f if the first result corresponds to the most specific
  structure type of v, #t otherwise.

                                        *struct-type-info*
(struct-type-info struct-type) ~
 -> symbol?
    exact-nonnegative-integer?
    exact-nonnegative-integer?
    struct-accessor-procedure?
    struct-mutator-procedure?
    (listof exact-nonnegative-integer?)
    (or/c struct-type? #f)
    boolean?
  struct-type : struct-type? ~

Returns eight values that provide information about the structure type
descriptor struct-type, assuming that the type is controlled  by the
current inspector:

* name: the structure type’s name as a symbol;

* init-field-cnt: the number of fields defined by the structure type
  provided to the constructor procedure (not counting fields created by
  its ancestor types);

* auto-field-cnt: the number of fields defined by the structure type
  without a counterpart in the constructor procedure (not counting
  fields created by its ancestor types);

* accessor-proc: an accessor procedure for the structure type, like the
  one returned by make-struct-type;

* mutator-proc: a mutator procedure for the structure type, like the one
  returned by make-struct-type;

* immutable-k-list: an immutable list of exact non-negative integers
  that correspond to immutable fields for the structure type;

* super-type: a structure type descriptor for the most specific ancestor
  of the type that is controlled by the current inspector, or #f if no
  ancestor is controlled by the current inspector;

* skipped?: #f if the seventh result is the most specific ancestor type
  or if the type has no supertype, #t otherwise.

If the type for struct-type is not controlled by the current inspector,
the exn:fail:contract exception is raised.

                                        *struct-type-make-constructor*
(struct-type-make-constructor struct-type) ~
 -> struct-constructor-procedure?
  struct-type : struct-type? ~

Returns a constructor procedure to create instances of the type for
struct-type.  If the type for struct-type is not controlled by the
current inspector, the exn:fail:contract exception is raised.

                                        *struct-type-make-predicate*
(struct-type-make-predicate struct-type) -> any ~
  struct-type : any/c ~

Returns a predicate procedure to recognize instances of the type for
struct-type.  If the type for struct-type is not controlled by the
current inspector, the exn:fail:contract exception is raised.

                                        *object-name*
(object-name v) -> any ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns a value for the name of v if v has a name, #f otherwise. The
argument v can be any value, but only (some) procedures, structures,
structure types, structure type properties, regexp values, ports, and
loggers have names. See also [missing].

The name (if any) of a procedure is always a symbol. The
procedure-rename function creates a procedure with a specific name.

If a structure’s type implements the prop:object-name property, and the
value of the prop:object-name property is an integer, then the
corresponding field of the structure is the name of the structure.
Otherwise, the property value must be a procedure, which is called with
the structure as argument, and the result is the name of the structure.
If a structure is a procedure as implemented by one of its fields (i.e.,
the prop:procedure property value for the structure’s type is an
integer), then its name is the implementing procedure’s name. Otherwise,
its name matches the name of the structure type that it instantiates.

The name of a regexp value is a string or byte string. Passing the
string or byte string to regexp, byte-regexp, pregexp, or byte-pregexp
(depending on the kind of regexp whose name was extracted) produces a
value that matches the same inputs.

The name of a port can be any value, but many tools use a path or string
name as the port’s for (to report source locations, for example).

The name of a logger is either a symbol or #f.

prop:object-name : struct-type-property? ~

A structure type property that allows structure types to customize  the
result of object-name applied to their instances. The property value can
be any of the following:

* A procedure proc of one argument: In this case, procedure proc
  receives the structure as an argument, and the result of proc is the
  object-name of the structure.

* An exact, non-negative integer between 0 (inclusive) and the number of
  non-automatic fields in the structure type (exclusive, not counting
  supertype fields): The integer identifies a field in the structure,
  and the field must be designated as immutable. The value of the field
  is used as the object-name of the structure.

Added in version 6.2.
