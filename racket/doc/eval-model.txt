Evaluation Model

Racket evaluation can be viewed as the simplification of expressions to
obtain values. For example, just as an elementary-school student
simplifies

  1 + 1 = 2

Racket evaluation simplifies

  (+ 1 1) -> 2

The arrow -> above replaces the more traditional = to emphasize that
evaluation proceeds in a particular direction towards simpler
expressions. In particular, a value is an expression that evaluation
simplifies no further, such as the number 2.

1. Sub-expression Evaluation and Continuations

Some simplifications require more than one step. For example:

  (- 4 (+ 1 1)) -> (- 4 2) -> 2

An expression that is not a value can always be partitioned into two
parts: a redex, which is the part that changed in a single-step
simplification (highlighted), and the continuation, which is the
evaluation context surrounding an expression. In (- 4 (+ 1 1)), the
redex is (+ 1 1), and the continuation is (- 4 []), where [] takes the
place of the redex. That is, the continuation says how to “continue”
after the redex is reduced to a value.

Before some things can be evaluated, some sub-expressions must be
evaluated; for example, in the application (- 4 (+ 1 1)), the
application of - cannot be reduced until the sub-expression (+ 1 1) is
reduced.

Thus, the specification of each syntactic form specifies how (some of)
its sub-expressions are evaluated, and then how the results are combined
to reduce the form away.

The dynamic extent of an expression is the sequence of evaluation steps
during which the expression contains the redex.

2. Tail Position

An expression expr1 is in tail position with respect to an enclosing
expression expr2 if, whenever expr1 becomes a redex, its continuation is
the same as was the enclosing expr2’s continuation.

For example, the (+ 1 1) expression is not in tail position with respect
to (- 4 (+ 1 1)). To illustrate, we use the notation C[expr] to mean the
expression that is produced by substituting expr in place of [] in the
continuation C:

  C[(- 4 (+ 1 1))] -> C[(- 4 2)]

In this case, the continuation for reducing (+ 1 1) is C[(- 4 [])], not
just C.

In contrast, (+ 1 1) is in tail position with respect to (if (zero? 0)
(+ 1 1) 3), because, for any continuation C,

  C[(if (zero? 0) (+ 1 1) 3)] -> C[(if #t (+ 1 1) 3)] -> C[(+ 1 1)]

The steps in this reduction sequence are driven by the definition of if,
and they do not depend on the continuation C. The “then” branch of an if
form is always in tail position with respect to the if form. Due to a
similar reduction rule for if and #f, the “else” branch of an if form is
also in tail position.

Tail-position specifications provide a guarantee about the asymptotic
space consumption of a computation. In general, the specification of
tail positions goes with each syntactic form, like if.

3. Multiple Return Values

A Racket expression can evaluate to multiple values, in the same way
that a procedure can accept multiple arguments.

Most continuations expect a particular number of result values.  Indeed,
most continuations, such as (+ [] 1) expect a single value. The
continuation (let-values ([(x y) []]) expr) expects two result values;
the first result replaces x in the body expr, and the second replaces y
in expr. The continuation (begin [] (+ 1 2)) accepts any number of
result values, because it ignores the result(s).

In general, the specification of a syntactic form indicates the number
of values that it produces and the number that it expects from each of
its sub-expression. In addition, some procedures (notably values)
produce multiple values, and some procedures (notably call-with-values)
create continuations internally that accept a certain number of values.

4. Top-Level Variables

Given

  x = 10

then an algebra student simplifies x + 1 as follows:

  x + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11

Racket works much the same way, in that a set of top-level variables are
available for substitutions on demand during evaluation. For example,
given

  (define x 10)

then

  (+ x 1) -> (+ 10 1) -> 11

In Racket, the way definitions appear is just as important as the way
that they are used. Racket evaluation thus keeps track of both
definitions and the current expression, and it extends the set of
definitions in response to evaluating forms such as define.

Each evaluation step, then, takes the current set of definitions and
program to a new set of definitions and program. Before a define can be
moved into the set of definitions, its right-hand expression must be
reduced to a value.

  defined:
  evaluate:(begin (define x (+ 9 1)) (+ x 1))
->defined:
  evaluate:(begin (define x 10) (+ x 1))
->defined: (define x 10)
  evaluate:(begin (void) (+ x 1))
->defined: (define x 10)
  evaluate:(+ x 1)
->defined: (define x 10)
  evaluate:(+ 10 1)
->defined: (define x 10)
  evaluate:11

Using set!, a program can change the value associated with an existing
top-level variable:

  defined: (define x 10)
  evaluate:(begin (set! x 8) x)
->defined: (define x 8)
  evaluate:(begin (void) x)
->defined: (define x 8)
  evaluate:x
->defined: (define x 8)
  evaluate:8

5. Objects and Imperative Update

In addition to set! for imperative update of top-level variables,
various procedures enable the modification of elements within a compound
data structure. For example, vector-set! modifies the content of a
vector.

To allow such modifications to data, we must distinguish between values,
which are the results of expressions, and objects, which hold the data
referenced by a value.

A few kinds of objects can serve directly as values, including booleans,
(void), and small exact integers. More generally, however, a value is a
reference to an object. For example, a value can be a reference to a
particular vector that currently holds the value 10 in its first slot.
If an object is modified, then the modification is visible through all
copies of the value that reference the same object.

In the evaluation model, a set of objects must be carried along with
each step in evaluation, just like the definition set. Operations that
create objects, such as vector, add to the set of objects:

  objects:
  defined:
  evaluate:(begin (define x (vector 10 20))
                  (define y x)
                  (vector-set! x 0 11)
                  (vector-ref y 0))
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 10 20))
  defined:
  evaluate:(begin (define x <o1>)
                  (define y x)
                  (vector-set! x 0 11)
                  (vector-ref y 0))
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 10 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
  evaluate:(begin (void)
                  (define y x)
                  (vector-set! x 0 11)
                  (vector-ref y 0))
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 10 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
  evaluate:(begin (define y x)
                  (vector-set! x 0 11)
                  (vector-ref y 0))
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 10 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
  evaluate:(begin (define y <o1>)
                  (vector-set! x 0 11)
                  (vector-ref y 0))
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 10 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
           (define y <o1>)
  evaluate:(begin (void)
                  (vector-set! x 0 11)
                  (vector-ref y 0))
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 10 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
           (define y <o1>)
  evaluate:(begin (vector-set! x 0 11)
                  (vector-ref y 0))
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 10 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
           (define y <o1>)
  evaluate:(begin (vector-set! <o1> 0 11)
                  (vector-ref y 0))
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 11 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
           (define y <o1>)
  evaluate:(begin (void)
                  (vector-ref y 0))
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 11 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
           (define y <o1>)
  evaluate:(vector-ref y 0)
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 11 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
           (define y <o1>)
  evaluate:(vector-ref <o1> 0)
->objects: (define <o1> (vector 11 20))
  defined: (define x <o1>)
           (define y <o1>)
  evaluate:11

The distinction between a top-level variable and an object reference is
crucial. A top-level variable is not a value; each time a variable
expression is evaluated, the value is extracted from the current set of
definitions. An object reference, in contrast is a value, and therefore
needs no further evaluation. The model evaluation steps above use
angle-bracketed <o1> for an object reference to distinguish it from a
variable name.

A direct object reference can never appear in a text-based source
program. A program representation created with datum->syntax, however,
can embed direct references to existing objects.

6. Object Identity and Comparisons

The eq? operator compares two values, returning #t when the values refer
to the same object. This form of equality is suitable for comparing
objects that support imperative update (e.g., to determine that the
effect of modifying an object through one reference is visible through
another reference). Also, an eq?  test evaluates quickly, and eq?-based
hashing is more lightweight than equal?-based hashing in hash tables.

In some cases, however, eq? is unsuitable as a comparison operator,
because the generation of objects is not clearly defined. In particular,
two applications of + to the same two exact integers may or may not
produce results that are eq?, although the results are always equal?.
Similarly, evaluation of a lambda form typically generates a new
procedure object, but it may re-use a procedure object previously
generated by the same source lambda form.

The behavior of a datatype with respect to eq? is generally specified
with the datatype and its associated procedures.

7. Garbage Collection

+See [missing] for functions related to garbage collection.

In the program state

objects: (define <o1> (vector 10 20))
         (define <o2> (vector 0))
defined: (define x <o1>)
evaluate:(+ 1 x)

evaluation cannot depend on <o2>, because it is not part of the program
to evaluate, and it is not referenced by any definition that is
accessible in the program. The object <o2> may therefore be removed from
the evaluation by garbage collection.

A few special compound datatypes hold weak references to objects. Such
weak references are treated specially by the garbage collector in
determining which objects are reachable for the remainder of the
computation. If an object is reachable only via a weak reference, then
the object can be reclaimed, and the weak reference is replaced by a
different value (typically #f).

As a special case, a fixnum is always considered reachable by the
garbage collector. Many other values are always reachable due to the way
they are implemented and used: A character in the Latin-1 range is
always reachable, because equal? Latin-1 characters are always eq?, and
all of the Latin-1 characters are referenced by an internal module.
Similarly, null, #t, #f, eof, and #<void> and are always reachable.
Values produced by quote remain reachable when the quote expression
itself is reachable.

8. Procedure Applications and Local Variables

Given

  f(x) = x + 10

then an algebra student simplifies f(7) as follows:

  f(7) = 7 + 10 = 17

The key step in this simplification is take the body of the defined
function f, and then replace each x with the actual value 7.

Racket procedure application works much the same way. A procedure is an
object, so evaluating (f 7) starts with a variable lookup:

  objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (+ x 10)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
  evaluate:(f 7)
->objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (+ x 10)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
  evaluate:(<p1> 7)

Unlike in algebra, however, the value associated with an argument can be
changed in the body of a procedure by using set!, as in the example
(lambda (x) (begin (set! x 3) x)). Since the value associated with x can
be changed, an actual value cannot be substituted for x when the
procedure is applied.

Instead, a new location is created for each variable on each
application. The argument value is placed in the location, and each
instance of the variable in the procedure body is replaced with the new
location:

  objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (+ x 10)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
  evaluate:(<p1> 7)
->objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (+ x 10)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
           (define xloc 7)
  evaluate:(+ xloc 10)
->objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (+ x 10)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
           (define xloc 7)
  evaluate:(+ 7 10)
->objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (+ x 10)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
           (define xloc 7)
  evaluate:17

A location is the same as a top-level variable, but when a location is
generated, it (conceptually) uses a name that has not been used before
and that cannot be generated again or accessed directly.

Generating a location in this way means that set! evaluates for local
variables in the same way as for top-level variables, because the local
variable is always replaced with a location by the time the set! form is
evaluated:

  objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (begin (set! x 3) x)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
  evaluate:(f 7)
->objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (begin (set! x 3) x)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
  evaluate:(<p1> 7)
->objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (begin (set! x 3) x)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
           (define xloc 7)
  evaluate:(begin (set! xloc 3) xloc)
->objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (begin (set! x 3) x)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
           (define xloc 3)
  evaluate:(begin (void) xloc)
->objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (begin (set! x 3) x)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
           (define xloc 3)
  evaluate:xloc
->objects: (define <p1> (lambda (x) (begin (set! x 3) x)))
  defined: (define f <p1>)
           (define xloc 3)
  evaluate:3

The substitution and location-generation step of procedure application
requires that the argument is a value. Therefore, in ((lambda (x) (+ x
10)) (+ 1 2)), the (+ 1 2) sub-expression must be simplified to the
value 3, and then 3 can be placed into a location for x. In other words,
Racket is a call-by-value language.

Evaluation of a local-variable form, such as (let ([x (+ 1 2)]) expr),
is the same as for a procedure call. After (+ 1 2) produces a value, it
is stored in a fresh location that replaces every instance of x in expr.

9. Variables and Locations

A variable is a placeholder for a value, and expressions in an initial
program refer to variables. A top-level variable is both a variable and
a location. Any other variable is always replaced by a location at
run-time, so that evaluation of expressions involves only locations. A
single local variable (i.e., a non-top-level, non-module-level
variable), such as a procedure argument, can correspond to different
locations through different instantiations.

For example, in the program

  (define y (+ (let ([x 5]) x) 6))

both y and x are variables. The y variable is a top-level variable, and
the x is a local variable. When this code is evaluated, a location is
created for x to hold the value 5, and a location is also created for y
to hold the value 11.

The replacement of a variable with a location during evaluation
implements Racket’s lexical scoping. For example, when a
procedure-argument variable x is replaced by the location xloc, then it
is replaced throughout the body of the procedure, including any nested
lambda forms. As a result, future references of the variable always
access the same location.

10. Modules and Module-Level Variables

+See [missing] for the syntax of modules.

Most definitions in Racket are in modules. In terms of evaluation, a
module is essentially a prefix on a defined name, so that different
modules can define the name. That is, a module-level variable is like a
top-level variable from the perspective of evaluation.

One difference between a module and a top-level definition is that a
module can be declared without instantiating its module-level
definitions. Evaluation of a require instantiates (i.e., triggers the
instantiation of) a declared module, which creates variables that
correspond to its module-level definitions.

For example, given the module declaration

  (module m racket
    (define x 10))

the evaluation of (require 'm) creates the variable x and installs 10 as
its value. This x is unrelated to any top-level definition of x.

10.1. Phases

A module can be instantiated in multiple phases. A phase is an integer
that, again, is effectively a prefix on the names of module-level
definitions. A top-level require instantiates a module at phase 0, if
the module is not already instantiated at phase 0.  A top-level (require
(for-syntax ....)) instantiates a module at phase 1 (if it is not
already instantiated at that level); for-syntax also has a different
binding effect on further program parsing, as described in [missing].

Within a module, some definitions are shifted by a phase already; the
begin-for-syntax form is similar to begin, but it shifts expressions and
definitions by a relative phase 1. Thus, if the module is instantiated
at phase 1, the variables defined with begin-for-syntax are created at
phase 2, and so on. Moreover, this relative phase acts as another layer
of prefixing, so that a define of x and a begin-for-syntax-wrapped
define of x can co-exist in a module without colliding. A
begin-for-syntax form can be nested within a begin-for-syntax form, in
which case definitions and expressions are in relative phase 2, and so
on. Higher phases are mainly related to program parsing, instead of
normal evaluation.

If a module instantiated at phase n requires another module, then the
required module is first instantiated at phase n, and so on
transitively. (Module requires cannot form cycles.) If a module
instantiated at phase n requires for-syntax another module, the other
module becomes available at phase n+1, and it may later be instantiated
at phase n+1.  If a module that is available at phase n for n>0 requires
for-template another module, the other module becomes available at phase
n-1, and so on. Instantiations of available modules above phase 0 are
triggered on demand as described in [missing].

A final distinction among module instantiations is that multiple
instantiations may exist at phase 1 and higher. These instantiations are
created by the parsing of module forms (see [missing]), and are, again,
conceptually distinguished by prefixes.

Top-level variables can exist in multiple phases in the same way as
within modules. For example, define within begin-for-syntax creates a
phase 1 variable. Furthermore, reflective operations like
make-base-namespace and eval provide access to top-level variables in
higher phases, while module instantiations (triggered by require)
relative to such top-levels are in corresponding higher phases.

10.2. The Separate Compilation Guarantee

When a module is compiled, its phase 1 is instantiated. This can, in
turn, trigger the transitive instantiation of many other modules at
other phases, including phase 1. Racket provides a very strong guarantee
about this instantiation called "The Separate Compilation Guarantee":

"Any effects of the instantiation of the module’s phase 1 due to
compilation on the Racket runtime system are discarded."

The guarantee concerns effects. There are two different kinds of
effects: internal and external.

Internal effects are exemplified by mutation.  Mutation is the action of
a function such as set-box!, which changes the value contained in the
box. The modified box is not observable outside of Racket, so the effect
is said to be "internal". By definition, internal effects is not
detectable outside of the Racket program.

External effects are exemplified by input/output (or I/O). I/O is the
action of a function such as tcp-connect, which communicates with the
operating system to send network packets outside of the machine running
Racket. The transmission of these packets is observable outside of
Racket, in particular by the receiver computer or any routers in
between. External effects exist to be detectable outside of the Racket
program and are often detectable using physical processes.

An effect is discarded when it is no longer detectable. For instance, a
mutation of a box from 3 to 4 would be discarded if it ceases to be
detectable that it was ever changed, and thus would still contain 3.
Because external effects are intrinsically observable outside of Racket,
they are irreversible and cannot be discarded.

Thus, The Separate Compilation Guarantee only concerns effects like
mutation, because they are exclusively effects "on the Racket runtime
system" and not "on the physical universe".

There are many things a Racket program can do that appear to be internal
effects, but are actually external effects. For instance, bytes-set! is
typically an internal effect, except when the bytes were created by
make-shared-bytes which is allocated in space observable by other
processes. Thus, effects which modify them are not discardable, so
bytes-set!, in this case, is an external effect.

The opposite is also true: some things which appear to be external are
actually internal. For instance, if a Racket program starts multiple
threads and uses mutation to communicate between them, that mutation is
purely internal, because Racket’s threads are defined entirely
internally.

Furthermore, whenever a Racket program calls an unsafe function, the
Racket runtime system makes no promises about its effects. For instance,
all foreign calls use ffi/unsafe, so all foreign calls are unsafe and
their effects cannot be discarded by Racket.

Finally, The Separate Compilation Guarantee only concerns instantiations
at phase 1 during compilation and not all phase 1 instantiations
generally, such as when its phase 1 is required and used for effects via
reflective mechanisms.

The practical consequence of this guarantee is that because effects are
never visible, no module can detect whether a module it requires is
already compiled. Thus, it can never change the compilation of one
module to have already compiled a different module. In particular, if
module A is shared by the phase 1 portion of modules X and Y, then any
internal effects while X is compiled are not visible during the
compilation of Y, regardless of whether X and Y are compiled during the
same execution of Racket’s runtime system.

The following set of modules demonstrate this guarantee. First, we
define a module with the ability to observe effects via a box:

  (module box racket/base
    (provide (all-defined-out))
    (define b (box 0)))

Next, we define two syntax transformers that use and mutate this box:

  (module transformers racket/base
    (provide (all-defined-out))
    (require (for-syntax racket/base
                         'box))
    (define-syntax (sett stx)
      (set-box! b 2)
      #'(void))
    (define-syntax (gett stx)
      #`#,(unbox b)))

Next, we define a module that uses these transformers:

  (module user racket/base
    (provide (all-defined-out))
    (require 'transformers)
    (sett)
    (define gott (gett)))

Finally, we define a second module that uses these transformers:

  (module test racket/base
    (require 'box 'transformers 'user)
    (displayln gott)
    (displayln (gett))
   
    (sett)
    (displayln (gett))
   
    (displayln (unbox b)))

This module displays:

* 2, because the module 'user expanded to 2.

* 0, because the effects of compiling 'user were discarded.

* 2, because the effect of (sett) inside 'test is not discarded.

* 0, because the effects at phase 1 are irrelevant to the phase 0 use of
  b.

Furthermore, this display will never change, regardless of which order
these modules are compiled in or whether they are compiled at the same
time or separately.

In contrast, if these modules were changed to store the value of b in a
file on the filesystem, then the program would only display 2.

The Separate Compilation Guarantee is described in more detail in
"Composable and Compilable Macros" [Flatt02], including informative
examples. The paper "Advanced Macrology and the implementation of Typed
Scheme" [Culpepper07] also contains an extended example of why it is
important and how to design effectful syntactic extensions in its
presence.

10.3. Cross-Phase Persistent Modules

Module declarations that fit a highly constrained form—including a
(#%declare #:cross-phase-persistent) form in the module body—create
cross-phase persistent modules. A cross-phase persistent module’s
instantiations across all phases and module registries share the
variables produced by the first instantiation of the module.

The intent of a cross-phase persistent module is to support values that
are recognizable after phase crossings. For example, when a macro
transformer running in phase 1 raises a syntax error as represented by a
exn:fail:syntax instance, the instance is recognizable by a phase-0
exception handler wrapping a call to eval or expand that triggered the
syntax error, because the exn:fail:syntax structure type is defined by a
cross-phase persistent module.

A cross-phase persistent module imports only other cross-phase
persistent modules, and it contains only definitions that bind variables
to functions, structure types and related functions, or structure-type
properties and related functions. A cross-phase persistent module never
includes syntax literals (via quote-syntax) or variable references (via
#%variable-reference). See [missing] for the syntactic specification of
a cross-phase persistent module declaration.

A documented module should be assumed non-cross-phase persistent unless
it is specified as cross-phase persistent (such as racket/kernel).

10.4. Module Redeclarations

When a module is declared using a name for which a module is already
declared, the new declaration’s definitions replace and extend the old
declarations. If a variable in the old declaration has no counterpart in
the new declaration, the old variable continues to exist, but its
binding is not included in the lexical information for the module body.
If a new variable definition has a counterpart in the old declaration,
it effectively assigns to the old variable.

If a module is instantiated in any phases before it is redeclared, each
redeclaration of the module is immediately instantiated in the same
phases.

If the current inspector does not manage a module’s declaration
inspector (see [missing]), then the module cannot be redeclared.
Similarly, a cross-phase persistent module cannot be redeclared. Even if
redeclrection succeeds, instantiation of a module that is previously
instantiated may fail if instantiation for the redeclaration attempts to
modify variables that are constant (see
compile-enforce-module-constants).

10.5. Submodules

A module or module* form within a top-level module form declares a
submodule. A submodule is accessed relative to its enclosing module,
usually with a submod path. Submodules can be nested to any depth.

Although a submodule is lexically nested within a module, it cannot
necessarily access the bindings of its enclosing module directly. More
specifically, a submodule declared with module cannot require from its
enclosing module, but the enclosing module can require the submodule. In
contrast, a submodule declared with module* conceptually follows its
enclosing module, so can require from its enclosing module, but the
enclosing module cannot require the submodule. Unless a submodule
imports from its enclosing module or vice-versa, then visits or
instantiations of the two modules are independent, and thier
implementations may even be loaded from bytecode at different times.

A submodule declared with module can import any preceding submodule
declared with module. A submodule declared with module* can import any
preceding module declared with module* and any submodule declared with
module.

When a submodule declaration has the form (module* name #f ....), then
all of the bindings of the enclosing module’s bodies are visible in the
submodule’s body, and the submodule implicitly imports the enclosing
module. The submodule can provide any bindings that it inherits from its
enclosing module.

11. Continuation Frames and Marks

+See [missing] for continuation-mark forms and functions.

Every continuation C can be partitioned into continuation frames C1, C2,
..., Cn such that C = C1[C2[...[Cn]]], and no frame Ci can be itself
partitioned into smaller continuations. Evaluation steps add and remove
frames to the current continuation, typically one at a time.

Each frame is conceptually annotated with a set of continuation marks. A
mark consists of a key and its value; the key is an arbitrary value, and
each frame includes at most one mark for any key. Various operations set
and extract marks from continuations, so that marks can be used to
attach information to a dynamic extent. For example, marks can be used
to record information for a “stack trace” to be used when an exception
is raised, or to implement dynamic scope.

12. Prompts, Delimited Continuations, and Barriers

+See [missing] for continuation and prompt functions.

A prompt is a special kind of continuation frame that is annotated with
a specific prompt tag (essentially a continuation mark). Various
operations allow the capture of frames in the continuation from the
redex position out to the nearest enclosing prompt with a particular
prompt tag; such a continuation is sometimes called a delimited
continuation. Other operations allow the current continuation to be
extended with a captured continuation (specifically, a composable
continuation). Yet other operations abort the computation to the nearest
enclosing prompt with a particular tag, or replace the continuation to
the nearest enclosing prompt with another one. When a delimited
continuation is captured, the marks associated with the relevant frames
are also captured.

A continuation barrier is another kind of continuation frame that
prohibits certain replacements of the current continuation with another.
Specifically, a continuation can be replaced by another only when the
replacement does not introduce any continuation barriers. It may remove
continuation barriers only through jumps to continuations that are a
tail of the current continuation.  A continuation barrier thus prevents
“downward jumps” into a continuation that is protected by a barrier.
Certain operations install barriers automatically; in particular, when
an exception handler is called, a continuation barrier prohibits the
continuation of the handler from capturing the continuation past the
exception point.

A escape continuation is essentially a derived concept. It combines a
prompt for escape purposes with a continuation for mark-gathering
purposes. As the name implies, escape continuations are used only to
abort to the point of capture.

13. Threads

+See [missing] for thread and synchronization functions.

Racket supports multiple threads of evaluation.  Threads run
concurrently, in the sense that one thread can preempt another without
its cooperation, but threads currently all run on the same processor
(i.e., the same underlying OS process and thread). See also [missing].

Threads are created explicitly by functions such as thread. In terms of
the evaluation model, each step in evaluation actually consists of
multiple concurrent expressions, up to one per thread, rather than a
single expression. The expressions all share the same objects and
top-level variables, so that they can communicate through shared state,
and sequential consistency is guaranteed (i.e., the result is consistent
with some global sequence imposed on all evaluation steps across
threads). Most evaluation steps involve a single step in a single
expression, but certain synchronization primitives require multiple
threads to progress together in one step.

In addition to the state that is shared among all threads, each thread
has its own private state that is accessed through thread cells. A
thread cell is similar to a normal mutable object, but a change to the
value inside a thread cell is seen only when extracting a value from the
cell from the same thread. A thread cell can be preserved; when a new
thread is created, the creating thread’s value for a preserved thread
cell serves as the initial value for the cell in the created thread. For
a non-preserved thread cell, a new thread sees the same initial value
(specified when the thread cell is created) as all other threads.

14. Parameters

+See [missing] for parameter forms and functions.

Parameters are essentially a derived concept in Racket; they are defined
in terms of continuation marks and thread cells. However, parameters are
also built in, in the sense that some primitive procedures consult
parameter values. For example, the default output stream for primitive
output operations is determined by a parameter.

A parameter is a setting that is both thread-specific and
continuation-specific. In the empty continuation, each parameter
corresponds to a preserved thread cell; a corresponding parameter
procedure accesses and sets the thread cell’s value for the current
thread.

In a non-empty continuation, a parameter’s value is determined through a
parameterization that is associated with the nearest enclosing
continuation frame though a continuation mark (whose key is not directly
accessible). A parameterization maps each parameter to a preserved
thread cell, and the combination of thread cell and current thread
yields the parameter’s value. A parameter procedure sets or accesses the
relevant thread cell for its parameter.

Various operations, such as parameterize or call-with-parameterization,
install a parameterization into the current continuation’s frame.

15. Exceptions

+See [missing] for exception forms, functions, and types.

Exceptions are essentially a derived concept in Racket; they are defined
in terms of continuations, prompts, and continuation marks.  However,
exceptions are also built in, in the sense that primitive forms and
procedures may raise exceptions.

An exception handler to catch exceptions can be associated with a
continuation frame though a continuation mark (whose key is not directly
accessible). When an exception is raised, the current continuation’s
marks determine a chain of exception handler procedures that are
consulted to handle the exception. A handler for uncaught exceptions is
designated through a built-in parameter.

One potential action of an exception handler is to abort the current
continuation up to an enclosing prompt with a particular prompt tag.
The default handler for uncaught exceptions, in particular, aborts to a
particular tag for which a prompt is always present, because the prompt
is installed in the outermost frame of the continuation for any new
thread.

16. Custodians

+See [missing] for custodian functions.

A custodian manages a collection of threads, file-stream ports, TCP
ports, TCP listeners, UDP sockets, and byte converters.  Whenever a
thread, etc., is created, it is placed under the management of the
current custodian as determined by the current-custodian parameter.

Custodians also manage eventspaces from racket/gui/base.

Except for the root custodian, every custodian itself is managed by a
custodian, so that custodians form a hierarchy. Every object managed by
a subordinate custodian is also managed by the custodian’s owner.

When a custodian is shut down via custodian-shutdown-all, it forcibly
and immediately closes the ports, TCP connections, etc., that it
manages, as well as terminating (or suspending) its threads. A custodian
that has been shut down cannot manage new objects.  After the current
custodian is shut down, if a procedure is called that attempts to create
a managed resource (e.g., open-input-file, thread), then the
exn:fail:contract exception is raised.

A thread can have multiple managing custodians, and a suspended thread
created with thread/suspend-to-kill can have zero custodians. Extra
custodians become associated with a thread through thread-resume (see
[missing]). When a thread has multiple custodians, it is not necessarily
killed by a custodian-shutdown-all, but shut-down custodians are removed
from the thread’s managing set, and the thread is killed when its
managing set becomes empty.

The values managed by a custodian are only weakly held by the custodian.
As a result, a will can be executed for a value that is managed by a
custodian. In addition, a custodian only weakly references its
subordinate custodians; if a subordinate custodian is unreferenced but
has its own subordinates, then the custodian may be collected, at which
point its subordinates become immediately subordinate to the collected
custodian’s superordinate custodian.

In addition to the other entities managed by a custodian, a custodian
box created with make-custodian-box strongly holds onto a value placed
in the box until the box’s custodian is shut down. The custodian only
weakly retains the box itself, however (so the box and its content can
be collected if there are no other references to them).

When Racket is compiled with support for per-custodian memory accounting
(see custodian-memory-accounting-available?), the current-memory-use
procedure can report a custodian-specific result.  This result
determines how much memory is occupied by objects that are reachable
from the custodian’s managed values, especially its threads, and
including its sub-custodians’ managed values. If an object is reachable
from two custodians where neither is an ancestor of the other, an object
is arbitrarily charged to one or the other, and the choice can change
after each collection; objects reachable from both a custodian and its
descendant, however, are reliably charged to the custodian and not to
the descendants, unless the custodian can reach the objects only through
a descendant custodian or a descendant’s thread.  Reachability for
per-custodian accounting does not include weak references, references to
threads managed by other custodians, references to other custodians, or
references to custodian boxes for other custodians.
