Exiting

                                        *exit*
(exit [v]) -> any ~
  v : any/c = #t ~

Passes v to the current exit handler. If the exit handler does not
escape or terminate the thread, #<void> is returned.

                                        *exit-handler*
(exit-handler) -> (any/c . -> . any) ~
(exit-handler proc) -> void?
  proc : (any/c . -> . any) ~

A parameter that determines the current exit handler. The exit handler
is called by exit.

The default exit handler in the Racket executable takes any argument,
calls plumber-flush-all on the original plumber, and shuts down the
OS-level Racket process. The argument is used as the OS-level exit code
if it is an exact integer between 1 and 255 (which normally means
“failure”); otherwise, the exit code is 0, (which normally means
“success”).

                                        *executable-yield-handler*
(executable-yield-handler) -> (byte? . -> . any) ~
(executable-yield-handler proc) -> void?
  proc : (byte? . -> . any) ~

A parameter that determines a procedure to be called as the Racket
process is about to exit normally. The procedure associated with this
parameter is not called when exit (or, more precisely, the default exit
handler) is used to exit early. The argument to the handler is the
status code that is returned to the system on exit. The default
executable-yield handler simply returns #<void>.

The scheme/gui/base library sets this parameter to wait until all frames
are closed, timers stopped, and queued events handled in the main
eventspace. See scheme/gui/base for more information.
