Counting Positions, Lines, and Columns

By default, Racket keeps track of the position in a port as the number
of bytes that have been read from or written to any port (independent of
the read/write position, which is accessed or changed with
file-position). Optionally, however, Racket can track the position in
terms of characters (after UTF-8 decoding), instead of bytes, and it can
track line locations and column locations; this optional tracking must
be specifically enabled for a port via port-count-lines! or the
port-count-lines-enabled parameter. Position, line, and column locations
for a port are used by read-syntax. Position and line locations are
numbered from 1; column locations are numbered from 0.

When counting lines, Racket treats linefeed, return, and return-linefeed
combinations as a line terminator and as a single position (on all
platforms). Each tab advances the column count to one before the next
multiple of 8. When a sequence of bytes in the range 128 to 253 forms a
UTF-8 encoding of a character, the position/column is incremented once
for each byte, and then decremented appropriately when a complete
encoding sequence is discovered. See also [missing] for more information
on UTF-8 decoding for ports.

A position is known for any port as long as its value can be expressed
as a fixnum (which is more than enough tracking for realistic
applications in, say, syntax-error reporting).  If the position for a
port exceeds the value of the largest fixnum, then the position for the
port becomes unknown, and line and column tacking is disabled.
Return-linefeed combinations are treated as a single character position
only when line and column counting is enabled.

Custom ports can define their own counting functions, which are not
subject to the rules above, except that the counting functions are
invoked only when tracking is specifically enabled with
port-count-lines!.

                                        *port-count-lines!*
(port-count-lines! port) -> void? ~
  port : port? ~

Turns on line location and column location counting for a port. Counting
can be turned on at any time, though generally it is turned on before
any data is read from or written to a port. At the point that line
counting is turned on, port-next-location typically starts reporting as
its last result (one more than) the number of characters read since line
counting was enabled, instead of (one more than) bytes read since the
port was opened.

When a port is created, if the value of the port-count-lines-enabled
parameter is true, then line counting is automatically enabled for the
port. Line counting cannot be disabled for a port after it is enabled.

                                        *port-counts-lines?*
(port-counts-lines? port) -> boolean? ~
  port : port? ~

Returns #t if line location and column location counting has been
enabled for port, #f otherwise.

                                        *port-next-location*
(port-next-location port) ~
 -> (or/c exact-positive-integer? #f)
    (or/c exact-nonnegative-integer? #f)
    (or/c exact-positive-integer? #f)
  port : port? ~

Returns three values: an integer or #f for the line number of the next
read/written item, an integer or #f for the next item’s column, and an
integer or #f for the next item’s position. The next column and position
normally increase as bytes are read from or written to the port, but if
line/character counting is enabled for port, the column and position
results can decrease after reading or writing a byte that ends a UTF-8
encoding sequence.

If line counting is not enabled for a port, than the first two results
are #f, and the last result is one more than the number of bytes read so
far. At the point when line counting is enabled, the first two results
typically become non-#f, and last result starts reporting characters
instead of bytes, typically starting from the point when line counting
is enabled.

Even with line counting enabled, a port may return #f values if it
somehow cannot keep track of lines, columns, or positions.

                                        *set-port-next-location!*
(set-port-next-location! port           ~
                         line          
                         column        
                         position) -> void?
  port : port? ~
  line : (or/c exact-positive-integer? #f) ~
  column : (or/c exact-nonnegative-integer? #f) ~
  position : (or/c exact-positive-integer? #f) ~

Sets the next line, column, and position for port. If line counting has
not been enabled for port or if port is a custom port that defines its
own counting function, then set-port-next-location! has no effect.

                                        *port-count-lines-enabled*
(port-count-lines-enabled) -> boolean? ~
(port-count-lines-enabled on?) -> void?
  on? : any/c ~

A parameter that determines whether line counting is enabled
automatically for newly created ports. The default value is #f.
