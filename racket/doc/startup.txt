Running Racket or GRacket

The core Racket run-time system is available in two main variants:

* Racket, which provides the primitives libraries on which racket/base
  is implemented. On Unix and Mac OS X, the executable is called racket.
  On Windows, the executable is called Racket.exe.

* GRacket, which is a GUI variant of racket to the degree that the
  system distinguishes them. On Unix, the executable is called gracket,
  and single-instance flags and X11-related flags are handled and
  communicated specially to the racket/gui/base library. On Windows, the
  executable is called GRacket.exe, and it is a GUI application (as
  opposed to a console application) that implements single-instance
  support. On Mac OS X, the gracket script launches GRacket.app.

1. Initialization

On start-up, the top-level environment contains no bindings—not even
#%app for function application. Primitive modules with names that start
with #% are defined, but they are not meant for direct use, and the set
of such modules can change.  For example, the '#%kernel module is
eventually used to bootstrap the implementation of racket/base.

The first action of Racket or GRacket is to initialize
current-library-collection-paths to the result of
(find-library-collection-paths pre-extras extras), where pre-extras is
normally null and extras are extra directory paths provided in order in
the command line with -S/--search. An executable created from the Racket
or GRacket executable can embed paths used as pre-extras.

Racket and GRacket next require racket/init and racket/gui/init,
respectively, but only if the command line does not specify a require
flag (-t/--require, -l/--lib, or -u/--require-script) before any eval,
load, or read-eval-print-loop flag (-e/--eval, -f/--load, -r/--script,
-m/--main, or -i/--repl). The initialization library can be changed with
the -I configuration option. The configure-runtime submodule of the
initialization library or the 'configure-runtime property of the
initialization library’s language is used before the library is
instantiated; see Language Run-Time Configuration.

After potentially loading the initialization module, expression evals,
files loads, and module requires are executed in the order that they are
provided on the command line. If any raises an uncaught exception, then
the remaining evals, loads, and requires are skipped. If the first
require precedes any eval or load so that the initialization library is
skipped, then the configure-runtime submodule of the required module or
the 'configure-runtime property of the required module’s library
language is used before the module is instantiated; see Language
Run-Time Configuration.

After running all command-line expressions, files, and modules, Racket
or GRacket then starts a read-eval-print loop for interactive evaluation
if no command line flags are provided other than configuration options.
If any command-line argument is provided that is not a configuration
option, then the read-eval-print-loop is not started, unless the
-i/--repl flag is provided on the command line to specifically re-enable
it. In addition, just before the command line is started, Racket loads
the file (find-system-path 'init-file) and GRacket loads the file
(find-graphical-system-path 'init-file) is loaded, unless the
-q/--no-init-file flag is specified on the command line.

Finally, before Racket or GRacket exits, it calls the procedure that is
the current value of executable-yield-handler in the main thread, unless
the -V/--no-yield command-line flag is specified. Requiring
racket/gui/base sets this parameter call (racket 'yield).

2. Exit Status

The default exit status for a Racket or GRacket process is non-zero if
an error occurs during a command-line eval (via -e, etc.), load (via -f,
-r, etc.), or require (via --l, -t, etc.), but only when no
read-eval-print loop is started. Otherwise, the default exit status is
0.

In all cases, a call to exit (when the default exit handler is in place)
can end the process with a specific status value.

3. Init Libraries

 (require racket/init) package: base ~

The racket/init library is the default start-up library for Racket. It
re-exports the racket, racket/enter and racket/help libraries, and it
sets current-print to use pretty-print.

 (require racket/gui/init) package: gui-lib ~

The racket/gui/init library is the default start-up library for GRacket.
It re-exports the racket/init and racket/gui/base libraries, and it sets
current-load to use text-editor-load-handler.

 (require racket/language-info) package: base ~

The racket/language-info library provides a get-info function that takes
any value and returns another function; the returned function takes a
key value and a default value, and it returns '(#(racket/runtime-config
configure #f)) if the key is 'configure-runtime or the default value
otherwise.

+See also [missing] in [missing].

The vector '#(racket/language-info get-info #f) is suitable for
attaching to a module as its language info to get the same language
information as the racket/base language.

 (require racket/runtime-config) package: base ~

The racket/runtime-config library provides a configure function that
takes any value and sets print-as-expression to #t.

The vector #(racket/runtime-config configure #f) is suitable as a member
of a list of runtime-configuration specification (as returned by a
module’s language-information function for the key 'configure-runtime)
to obtain the same runtime configuration as for the racket/base
language.

4. Command Line

The Racket and GRacket executables recognize the following command-line
flags:

* File and expression options:

  * -e >expr< or --eval >expr< : evals >expr<. The results of the
    evaluation are printed via current-print.

  * -f >file< or --load >file< : loads >file<; if >file< is "-", then
    expressions are read and evaluated from standard input.

  * -t >file< or --require >file< : requires >file<, and then requires
    (submod (file ">file<") main) if available.

  * -l >path< or --lib >path< : requires (lib ">path<"), and then
    requires (submod (lib ">path<") main) if available.

  * -p >package< : requires (planet ">package<"), and then  requires
    (submod (planet ">package<") main) if available.

  * -r >file< or --script  >file< : loads >file< Despite its name,
    --script is not usually used for Unix scripts. See [missing] for
    more information on scripts.  as a script. This flag is like -t
    >file< plus  -N >file< to set the program name and --  to cause all
    further command-line elements to be treated as  non-flag arguments.

  * -u >file< or --require-script >file< : requires >file< as a script;
    This flag is like -t >file< plus -N >file< to set the program name
    and -- to cause all further command-line elements to be treated as
    non-flag arguments.

  * -k >n< >m< >p< : Loads code embedded in the executable from file
    position >n< to >m< and from >m< to >p<. (On Mac OS X, >n<, >m<, and
    >p< are relative to a __PLTSCHEME segment in the executable.) The
    first range is loaded in every new place, and any modules declared
    in that range are considered predefined in the sense of
    module-predefined?. This option is normally embedded in a
    stand-alone binary that also embeds Racket code.

  * -m or --main : Evaluates a call to main as bound in the top-level
    environment. All of the command-line arguments that are not
    processed as options (i.e., the arguments put into
    current-command-line-arguments) are passed as arguments to main. The
    results of the call are printed via current-print.

    The call to main is constructed as an expression (main arg-str ...)
    where the lexical context of the expression gives #%app and #%datum
    bindings as #%plain-app and #%datum, but the lexical context of main
    is the top-level environment.

* Interaction options:

  * -i or --repl : Runs an interactive read-eval-print loop, using
    either read-eval-print-loop (Racket) or
    graphical-read-eval-print-loop (GRacket) after showing (banner) and
    loading (find-system-path 'init-file). In the case of Racket,
    (read-eval-print-loop) is followed by (newline). For GRacket, supply
    the -z/--text-repl configuration option to use read-eval-print-loop
    (and newline) instead of graphical-read-eval-print-loop.

  * -n or --no-lib : Skips requiring the initialization library (i.e.,
    racket/init or racket/gui/init, unless it is changed with the -I
    flag) when not otherwise disabled.

  * -v or --version : Shows (banner).

  * -K or --back : GRacket, Mac OS X only; leave application in the
    background.

  * -V --no-yield : Skips final executable-yield-handler action, which
    normally waits until all frames are closed, etc. in the main
    eventspace before exiting for programs that use racket/gui/base.

* Configuration options:

  * -c or --no-compiled : Disables loading of compiled byte-code ".zo"
    files, by initializing current-compiled-file-paths to null. Use
    judiciously: this effectively ignores the content of all "compiled"
    subdirectories, so that any used modules are compiled on the
    fly—even racket/base and its dependencies—which leads to
    prohibitively expensive run times.

  * -q or --no-init-file : Skips loading (find-system-path 'init-file)
    for -i/--repl.

  * -z or --text-repl : GRacket only; changes -i/--repl to use
    textual-read-eval-print-loop instead of
    graphical-read-eval-print-loop.

  * -I >path< : Sets (lib ">path<") as the path to require to initialize
    the namespace, unless namespace initialization is disabled. Using
    this flag can effectively set the language for the read-eval-print
    loop and other top-level evaluation.

  * -X >dir< or --collects >dir< : Sets >dir< as the path to the main
    collection of libraries by making (find-system-path 'collects-dir)
    produce >dir<. If >dir< is an empty string, then (find-system-path
    'collects-dir) returns ".", but current-library-collection-paths is
    initialized to the empty list, and use-collection-link-paths is
    initialized to #f.

  * -S >dir< or --search >dir< : Adds >dir< to the default library
    collection search path after the main collection directory. If the
    -S/--dir flag is supplied multiple times, the search order is as
    supplied.

  * -R >paths< or --compiled >paths< : Sets the initial value of the
    current-compiled-file-roots parameter, overriding any
    PLTCOMPILEDROOTS setting. The >paths< argument is parsed in the same
    way as PLTCOMPILEDROOTS (see current-compiled-file-roots).

  * -G >dir< or --config >dir< : Sets the directory that is returned by
    (find-system-path 'config-dir).

  * -A >dir< or --addon >dir< : Sets the directory that is returned by
    (find-system-path 'addon-dir).

  * -U or --no-user-path : Omits user-specific paths in the search for
    collections, C libraries, etc. by initializing the
    use-user-specific-search-paths parameter to #f.

  * -N >file< or --name >file< : sets the name of the executable as
    reported by (find-system-path 'run-file) to >file<.

  * -J >name< or --wm-class >name< : GRacket, Unix only; sets the
    WM_CLASS program class to >name< (while the WM_CLASS program name is
    derived from the executable name or a -N/--name argument).

  * -j or --no-jit : Disables the native-code just-in-time compiler by
    setting the eval-jit-enabled parameter to #f.

  * -d or --no-delay : Disables on-demand parsing of compiled code and
    syntax objects by setting the read-on-demand-source parameter to #f.

  * -b or --binary : Requests binary mode, instead of text mode, for the
    process’s input, out, and error ports. This flag currently has no
    effect, because binary mode is always used.

  * -W >levels< or --warn >levels< : Sets the logging level for writing
    events to the original error port. The possible >level< values are
    the same as for the PLTSTDERR environment variable. See [missing]
    for more information.

  * -L >levels< or --syslog >levels< : Sets the logging level for
    writing events to the system log. The possible >level< values are
    the same as for the PLTSYSLOG environment variable. See [missing]
    for more information.

* Meta options:

  * -- : No argument following this flag is itself used as a flag.

  * -h or --help : Shows information about the command-line flags and
    start-up process and exits, ignoring all other flags.

If at least one command-line argument is provided, and if the first one
after any configuration option is not a flag, then a -u/--require-script
flag is implicitly added before the first non-flag argument.

If no command-line arguments are supplied other than configuration
options, then the -i/--repl flag is effectively added.

For GRacket on Unix, the follow flags are recognized when they appear at
the beginning of the command line, and they count as configuration
options (i.e., they do not disable the read-eval-print loop or prevent
the insertion of -u/--require-script):

* -display >display< : Sets the X11 display to use.

* -geometry >arg<, -bg >arg<, -background >arg<, -fg >arg<, -foreground
  >arg<, -fn >arg<, -font >arg<, -iconic, -name >arg<, -rv, -reverse,
  +rv, -selectionTimeout >arg<, -synchronous, -title >arg<, -xnllanguage
  >arg<, or -xrm >arg< : Standard X11 arguments that are mostly ignored
  but accepted for compatibility with other X11 programs. The
  -synchronous flag behaves in the usual way.

* -singleInstance : If an existing GRacket is already running on the
  same X11 display, if it was started on a machine with the same
  hostname, and if it was started with the same name as reported by
  (find-system-path 'run-file)—possibly set with the -N/--name
  command-line argument—then all non-option command-line arguments are
  treated as filenames and sent to the existing GRacket instance via the
  application file handler (see application-file-handler).

Similarly, on Mac OS X, a leading switch starting with -psn_ is treated
as a special configuration option. It indicates that Finder started the
application, so the current input, output, and error output are
redirected to a GUI window.

Multiple single-letter switches (the ones preceded by a single -) can be
collapsed into a single switch by concatenating the letters, as long as
the first switch is not --. The arguments for each switch are placed
after the collapsed switches (in the order of the switches). For
example,

  -ifve >file< >expr<

and

  -i -f >file< -v -e >expr<

are equivalent. If a collapsed -- appears before other collapsed
switches in the same collapsed set, it is implicitly moved to the end of
the collapsed set.

Extra arguments following the last option are available from the
current-command-line-arguments parameter.

5. Language Run-Time Configuration

+See also [missing] in [missing].

A module can have a configure-runtime submodule that is dynamic-required
before the module itself when a module is the main module of a program.
Normally, a configure-runtime submodule is added to a module by the
module’s language (i.e., by the #%module-begin form among a module’s
initial bindings).

Alternatively or in addition, an older protocol is in place. When a
module is implemented using #lang, the language after #lang can specify
configuration actions to perform when a module using the language is the
main module of a program. The language specifies run-time configuration
by

* attaching a 'module-language syntax property to the module as read
  from its source (see module and module-compiled-language-info);

* having the function indicated by the 'module-language syntax property
  recognize the 'configure-runtime key, for which it returns a list of
  vectors; each vector must have the form (vector mp name val) where mp
  is a module path, name is a symbol, and val is an arbitrary value; and

* having each function called as ((dynamic-require mp name) val)
  configure the run-time environment, typically by setting parameters
  such as current-print.

A 'configure-runtime query returns a list of vectors, instead of
directly configuring the environment, so that the indicated modules to
be bundled with a program when creating a stand-alone executable; see
[missing] in [missing].

syntax/module-reader.
