Security Guards

                                        *security-guard?*
(security-guard? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a security guard value as created by
make-security-guard, #f otherwise.

A security guard provides a set of access-checking procedures to be
called when a thread initiates access of a file, directory, or network
connection through a primitive procedure. For example, when a thread
calls open-input-file, the thread’s current security guard is consulted
to check whether the thread is allowed read access to the file. If
access is granted, the thread receives a port that it may use
indefinitely, regardless of changes to the security guard (although the
port’s custodian could shut down the port; see [missing]).

A thread’s current security guard is determined by the
current-security-guard parameter. Every security guard has a parent, and
a parent’s access procedures are called whenever a child’s access
procedures are called. Thus, a thread cannot increase its own access
arbitrarily by installing a new guard. The initial security guard
enforces no access restrictions other than those enforced by the host
platform.

  link-guard : (or/c (symbol? path? path? . -> . any) #f) = #f ~

Creates a new security guard as child of parent.

The file-guard procedure must accept three arguments:

* a symbol for the primitive procedure that triggered the access check,
  which is useful for raising an exception to deny access.

* a path (see [missing]) or #f for pathless queries, such as
  (current-directory), (filesystem-root-list), and (find-system-path
  symbol). A path provided to file-guard is not expanded or otherwise
  normalized before checking access; it may be a relative path, for
  example.

* a list containing one or more of the following  symbols:

  * 'read — read a file or directory

  * 'write — modify or create a file or directory

  * 'execute — execute a file

  * 'delete — delete a file or directory

  * 'exists — determine whether a file or directory exists, or that a
    path string is well-formed

  The 'exists symbol is never combined with other symbols in the last
  argument to file-guard, but any other combination is possible. When
  the second argument to file-guard is #f, the last argument always
  contains only 'exists.

The network-guard procedure must accept four arguments:

* a symbol for the primitive operation that triggered the access check,
  which is useful for raising an exception to deny access.

* an immutable string representing the target hostname for a client
  connection or the accepting hostname for a listening server; #f for a
  listening server or UDP socket that accepts connections at all of the
  host’s address; or #f an unbound UDP socket.

* an exact integer between 1 and 65535 (inclusive) representing the port
  number, or #f for an unbound UDP socket. In the case of a client
  connection, the port number is the target port on the server. For a
  listening server, the port number is the local port number.

* a symbol, either 'client or 'server, indicating whether the check is
  for the creation of a client connection or a listening server. The
  opening of an unbound UDP socket is identified as a 'client
  connection; explicitly binding the socket is identified as a 'server
  action.

The link-guard argument can be #f or a procedure of three arguments:

* a symbol for the primitive procedure that triggered the access check,
  which is useful for raising an exception to deny access.

* a complete path (see [missing]) representing the file to create as
  link.

* a path representing the content of the link, which may be relative the
  second-argument path; this path is not expanded or otherwise
  normalized before checking access.

If link-guard is #f, then a default procedure is used that always raises
exn:fail.

The return value of file-guard, network-guard, or link-guard is ignored.
To deny access, the procedure must raise an exception or otherwise
escape from the context of the primitive call. If the procedure returns,
the parent’s corresponding procedure is called on the same inputs, and
so on up the chain of security guards.

The file-guard, network-guard, and link-guard procedures are invoked in
the thread that called the access-checked primitive. Breaks may or may
not be enabled (see [missing]). Full continuation jumps are blocked
going into or out of the file-guard or network-guard call (see
[missing]).

                                        *current-security-guard*
(current-security-guard) -> security-guard? ~
(current-security-guard guard) -> void?
  guard : security-guard? ~

A parameter that determines the current security guard that controls
access to the filesystem and network.
