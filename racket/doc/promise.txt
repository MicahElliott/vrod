Delayed Evaluation

 (require racket/promise) package: base ~

The bindings documented in this section are provided by the
racket/promise and racket libraries, but not racket/base.

A promise encapsulates an expression to be evaluated on demand via
force. After a promise has been forced, every later force of the promise
produces the same result.

                                        *promise?*
(promise? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a promise, #f otherwise.

                                        *delay*
(delay body ...+) ~

Creates a promise that, when forced, evaluates the bodys to produce its
value.  The result is then cached, so further uses of force produce the
cached value immediately. This includes multiple values and exceptions.

                                        *lazy*
(lazy body ...+) ~

Like delay, if the last body produces a promise when forced, then this
promise is forced, too, to obtain a value. In other words, this form
creates a composable promise, where the computation of its body is
“attached” to the computation of the following promise, and a single
force iterates through the whole chain, tail-calling each step.

Note that the last body of this form must produce a single value, but
the value can itself be a delay promise that returns multiple values.

The lazy form is useful for implementing lazy libraries and languages,
where tail calls can be wrapped in a promise.

                                        *force*
(force v) -> any ~
  v : any/c ~

If v is a promise, then the promise is forced to obtain a value. If the
promise has not been forced before, then the result is recorded in the
promise so that future forces on the promise produce the same value (or
values). If forcing the promise raises an exception, then the exception
is similarly recorded so that forcing the promise will raise the same
exception every time.

If v is forced again before the original call to force returns, then the
exn:fail exception is raised.

If v is not a promise, then it is returned as the result.

                                        *promise-forced?*
(promise-forced? promise) -> boolean? ~
  promise : promise? ~

Returns #t if promise has been forced.

                                        *promise-running?*
(promise-running? promise) -> boolean? ~
  promise : promise? ~

Returns #t if promise is currently being forced. (Note that a promise
can be either running or forced but not both.)

1. Additional Promise Kinds

                                        *delay/name*
(delay/name body ...+) ~

Creates a “call-by-name” promise that is similar to delay-promises,
except that the resulting value is not cached.  This kind of promise is
essentially a thunk that is wrapped in a way that force recognizes.

If a delay/name promise forces itself, no exception is raised, the
promise is never considered “running” or “forced” in the sense of
promise-running? and promise-forced?.

                                        *delay/strict*
(delay/strict body ...+) ~

Creates a “strict” promise: it is evaluated immediately, and the result
is wrapped in a promise value.  Note that the body can evaluate to
multiple values, and forcing the resulting promise will return these
values.

                                        *delay/sync*
(delay/sync body ...+) ~

Produces a promise where an attempt to force the promise by a thread
other than one currently running the promise causes the force to block
until a result is available. This kind of promise is also a
synchronizable event for use with sync; syncing on the promise does not
force it, but merely waits until a value is forced by another thread.

If a promise created by delay/sync is forced on a thread that is already
running the promise, an exception is raised in the same way as for
promises created with delay.

                                        *delay/thread*
(delay/thread body/option ...+) ~
 
body/option = body
            | #:group thread-group-expr ~

Like delay/sync, but begins the computation immediately on a newly
created thread. The thread is created under the thread group specified
by thread-group-expr, which defaults to (make-thread-group). A #:group
specification can appear at most once.

Exceptions raised by the bodys are caught as usual and raised only when
the promise is forced. Unlike delay/sync, if the thread running body
terminates without producing a result or exception, force of the promise
raises an exception (instead of blocking).

                                        *delay/idle*
(delay/idle body/option ...+) ~
 
body/option = body
            | #:wait-for wait-evt-expr ~
            | #:work-while while-evt-expr ~
            | #:tick tick-secs-expr ~
            | #:use use-ratio-expr ~

Like delay/thread, but with the following differences:

* the computation does not start until the event produced by
  wait-evt-expr is ready, where the default is (system-idle-evt);

* the computation thread gets to work only when the process is otherwise
  idle as determined by while-evt-expr, which also defaults to
  (system-idle-evt);

* the thread is allowed to run only periodically: out of every
  tick-secs-expr (defaults to 0.2) seconds, the thread is allowed to run
  use-ratio-expr (defaults to 0.12) of the time proportionally; i.e.,
  the thread runs for (* tick-secs-expr use-ratio-expr) seconds.

If the promise is forced before the computation is done, it runs the
rest of the computation immediately without waiting on events or
periodically restricting evaluation.

A #:wait-for, #:work-while, #:tick, or #:use specification can appear at
most once.
