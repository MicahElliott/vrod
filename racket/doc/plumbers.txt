Plumbers

A plumber supports flush callbacks, which are normally triggered just
before a Racket process or place exits. For example, a flush callback
might flush an output port’s buffer.

Flush callbacks are roughly analogous to the standard C library’s
atexit, but flush callback can also be used in other, similar scenarios.

There is no guarantee that a flush callback will be called before a
process terminates—either because the plumber is not the original
plumber that is flushed by the default exit handler, or because the
process is terminated forcibly (e.g., through a custodian shutdown).

                                        *plumber?*
(plumber? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a plumber value, #f otherwise.

Added in version 6.0.1.8.

                                        *make-plumber*
(make-plumber) -> pluber? ~

Creates a new plumber.

Plumbers have no hierarchy (unlike custodians or inspectors), but a
flush callback can be registered in one plumber to call
plumber-flush-all with another plumber.

Added in version 6.0.1.8.

                                        *current-plumber*
(current-plumber) -> plumber? ~
(current-plumber plumber) -> void?
  plumber : plumber? ~

A parameter that determines a current plumber for flush callbacks. For
example, creating an output file stream port registers a flush callback
with the current plumber to flush the port as long as the port is
opened.

Added in version 6.0.1.8.

                                        *plumber-flush-all*
(plumber-flush-all plumber) -> void? ~
  plumber : plumber? ~

Calls all flush callbacks that are registered with plumber.

The flush callbacks to call are collected from plumber before the first
one is called. If a flush callback registers a new flush callback, the
new one is not called. If a flush callback raises an exception or
otherwise escapes, then the remaining flush callbacks are not called.

Added in version 6.0.1.8.

                                        *plumber-flush-handle?*
(plumber-flush-handle? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a flush handle represents the registration of a flush
callback, #f otherwise.

Added in version 6.0.1.8.

                                        *plumber-add-flush!*
(plumber-add-flush! plumber proc [weak?]) -> plumber-flush-handle? ~
  plumber : plumber? ~
  proc : (plumber-flush-handle? . -> . any) ~
  weak? : any/c = #f ~

Registers proc as a flush callback with plumber, so that proc is called
when plumber-flush-all is applied to plumber.

The result flush handle represents the registration of the callback, and
it can be used with plumber-flush-handle-remove! to unregister the
callback.

The given proc is reachable from the flush handle, but if weak? is true,
then plumber retains only a weak reference to the result flush handle
(and thus proc).

When proc is called as a flush callback, it is passed the same value
that is returned by plumber-add-flush! so that proc can conveniently
unregister itself. The call of proc is within a continuation barrier.

Added in version 6.0.1.8.

                                        *plumber-flush-handle-remove!*
(plumber-flush-handle-remove! handle) -> void? ~
  handle : plumber-flush-handle? ~

Unregisters the flush callback that was registered by the
plumber-add-flush! call that produced handle.

If the registration represented by handle has been removed already, then
plumber-flush-handle-remove! has no effect.

Added in version 6.0.1.8.
