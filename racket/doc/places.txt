Places

+[missing] in [missing] introduces places.

 (require racket/place) package: base ~

The bindings documented in this section are provided by the racket/place
and racket libraries, but not racket/base.

Places enable the development of parallel programs that take advantage
of machines with multiple processors, cores, or hardware threads.

Currently, parallel support for places is enabled only for Racket 3m
(which is the main variant of Racket), and only by default for Windows,
Linux x86/x86_64, and Mac OS X x86/x86_64. To enable support for other
platforms, use --enable-places with configure when building Racket. The
place-enabled? function reports whether places run in parallel.

A place is a parallel task that is effectively a separate instance of
the Racket virtual machine. Places communicate through place channels,
which are endpoints for a two-way buffered communication.

To a first approximation, place channels support only immutable,
transparent values as messages. In addition, place channels themselves
can be sent across channels to establish new (possibly more direct)
lines of communication in addition to any existing lines. Finally,
mutable values produced by shared-flvector, make-shared-flvector,
shared-fxvector, make-shared-fxvector, shared-bytes, and
make-shared-bytes can be sent across place channels; mutation of such
values is visible to all places that share the value, because they are
allowed in a shared memory space. See place-message-allowed?.

A place channel can be used as a synchronizable event (see [missing]) to
receive a value through the channel. A place channel is ready for
synchronization when a message is available on the channel, and the
place channel’s synchronization result is the message (which is removed
on synchronization). A place can also receive messages with
place-channel-get, and messages can be sent with place-channel-put.

Two place channels are equal? if they are endpoints for the same
underlying channels while both or neither is a place descriptor. Place
channels can be equal? without being eq? after being sent messages
through a place channel.

Constraints on messages across a place channel—and therefore on the
kinds of data that places share—enable greater parallelism than future,
even including separate garbage collection of separate places. At the
same time, the setup and communication costs for places can be higher
than for futures.

For example, the following expression launches two places, echoes a
message to each, and then waits for the places to terminate:

  (let ([pls (for/list ([i (in-range 2)])
                (dynamic-place "place-worker.rkt" 'place-main))])
     (for ([i (in-range 2)]
           [p pls])
        (place-channel-put p i)
        (printf "~a\n" (place-channel-get p)))
     (map place-wait pls))

The "place-worker.rkt" module must export the place-main function that
each place executes, where place-main must accept a single place channel
argument:

  #lang racket
  (provide place-main)
   
  (define (place-main pch)
    (place-channel-put pch (format "Hello from place ~a"
                                    (place-channel-get pch))))

Place channels are subject to garbage collection, like other Racket
values, and a thread that is blocked reading from a place channel can be
garbage collected if place channel’s writing end becomes unreachable.
However, unlike normal channel blocking, if otherwise unreachable
threads are mutually blocked on place channels that are reachable only
from the same threads, the threads and place channels are all considered
reachable, instead of unreachable.

When a place is created, its parameter values are generally set to the
initial values of the parameters in the creating place, except that the
current values of the following parameters are used:
current-library-collection-paths, current-library-collection-links, and
current-compiled-file-roots.

1. Using Places

                                        *place-enabled?*
(place-enabled?) -> boolean? ~

Returns #t if Racket is configured so that dynamic-place and place
create places that can run in parallel, #f if dynamic-place and place
are simulated using thread.

                                        *place?*
(place? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is a place descriptor value, #f otherwise. Every place
descriptor is also a place channel.

                                        *place-channel?*
(place-channel? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is place channel, #f otherwise.

                                        *dynamic-place*
(dynamic-place  module-path          ~
                start-name          
               [#:at location        ~
                #:named named]) -> place? ~
  module-path : (or/c module-path? path?) ~
  start-name : symbol? ~
  location : (or/c #f place-location?) = #f ~
  named : any/c = #f ~

Creates a place to run the procedure that is identified by  module-path
and start-name. The result is a  place descriptor value that represents
the new parallel task;  the place descriptor is returned immediately.
The place descriptor  value is also a place channel that permits
communication with  the place.

The module indicated by module-path must export a function  with the
name start-proc. The function must accept a single  argument, which is a
place channel that corresponds to the  other end of communication for
the place descriptor returned  by place.

If location is provided, it must be a place location, such as a
distributed places node produced by create-place-node.

When the place is created, the initial exit handler  terminates the
place, using the argument to the exit handler as the  place’s completion
value. Use (exit v) to  immediately terminate a place with the
completion value  v. Since a completion value is limited to an exact
integer  between 0 and 255, any other value for v  is converted to 0.

If the function indicated by module-path and  start-proc returns, then
the place terminates with the  completion value 0.

In the created place, the current-input-port parameter is  set to an
empty input port, while the values of the  current-output-port and
current-error-port  parameters are connected to the current ports in the
creating place.  If the output ports in the creating place are
file-stream ports, then the connected ports in the created place share
the  underlying streams, otherwise a thread in the creating place  pumps
bytes from the created place’s ports to the current ports in the
creating place.

The module-path argument must not be a module path of the  form (quote
sym) unless the module is predefined (see  module-predefined?).

The dynamic-place binding is protected in the sense of  protect-out, so
access to this operation can be prevented  by adjusting the code
inspector (see [missing]).

                                        *dynamic-place**
(dynamic-place*  module-path      ~
                 start-name      
                [#:in in          ~
                 #:out out        ~
                 #:err err]) -> place? ~
                                (or/c output-port? #f)
                                (or/c input-port? #f)
                                (or/c input-port? #f)
  module-path : (or/c module-path? path?) ~
  start-name : symbol? ~
  in : (or/c input-port? #f) = #f ~
  out : (or/c output-port? #f) = (current-output-port) ~
  err : (or/c output-port? #f) = (current-error-port) ~

Like dynamic-place, but accepts specific ports to the new  place’s
ports, and returns a created port when #f is  supplied for a port. The
in, out, and  err ports are connected to the current-input-port,
current-output-port, and current-error-port ports,  respectively, for
the  place.  Any of the ports can be #f, in which case a  file-stream
port (for an operating-system pipe)  is created and returned by
dynamic-place*. The  err argument can be 'stdout, in which case the
same file-stream port or that is supplied as standard  output is also
used for standard error.  For each port or  'stdout that is provided, no
pipe is created and the  corresponding returned value is #f.

The caller of dynamic-place* is responsible for closing all  returned
ports; none are closed automatically.

The dynamic-place* procedure returns four values:

* a place descriptor value representing the created place;

* an output port piped to the place’s standard input, or #f if in was a
  port;

* an input port piped from the place’s standard output, or #f if out was
  a port;

* an input port piped from the place’s standard error, or #f if err was
  a port or 'stdout.

The dynamic-place* binding is protected in the same way as
dynamic-place.

                                        *place*
(place id body ...+) ~

Creates a place that evaluates body   expressions with id bound to a
place channel.  The   bodys close only over id plus the top-level
bindings of the enclosing module, because the   bodys are lifted to a
function that is exported by   the module. The result of place is a
place descriptor,   like the result of dynamic-place.

The place binding is protected in the same way as  dynamic-place.

                                        *place**
(place* maybe-port ... ~
        id
        body ...+)
 
maybe-port = 
           | #:in in-expr ~
           | #:out out-expr ~
           | #:err err-expr ~

Like place, but supports optional #:in, #:out,  and #:err expressions
(at most one of each) to specify ports in the same way and  with the
same defaults as dynamic-place*. The result of  a place* form is also
the same as for  dynamic-place*.

The place* binding is protected in the same way as  dynamic-place.

                                        *place-wait*
(place-wait p) -> exact-integer? ~
  p : place? ~

Returns the completion value of the place indicated by p, blocking until
the place has terminated.

If any pumping threads were created to connect a non-file-stream port to
the ports in the place for p (see dynamic-place), place-wait returns
only when the pumping threads have completed.

                                        *place-dead-evt*
(place-dead-evt p) -> evt? ~
  p : place? ~

Returns a synchronizable event (see [missing]) that is ready for
synchronization if and only if p has terminated. The synchronization
result of a place-dead event is the place-dead event itself.

If any pumping threads were created to connect a non-file-stream port to
the ports in the place for p (see   dynamic-place), the event returned
by   place-dead-evt may become ready even if a pumping thread is   still
running.

                                        *place-kill*
(place-kill p) -> void? ~
  p : place? ~

Immediately terminates the place, setting the place’s completion value
to 1 if the place does not have a completion value already.

                                        *place-break*
(place-break p [kind]) -> void? ~
  p : place? ~
  kind : (or/c #f 'hang-up 'terminate) = #f ~

Sends the main thread of place p a break; see [missing].

                                        *place-channel*
(place-channel) -> place-channel? place-channel? ~

Returns two place channels. Data sent through the first channel can be
received through the second channel, and data sent through the second
channel can be received from the first.

Typically, one place channel is used by the current place to send
messages to a destination place; the other place channel is sent to the
destination place (via an existing place channel).

                                        *place-channel-put*
(place-channel-put pch v) -> void ~
  pch : place-channel? ~
  v : place-message-allowed? ~

Sends a message v on channel pch. Since place channels  are
asynchronous, place-channel-put calls are non-blocking.

See place-message-allowed? form information on automatic coercions in v,
such as converting a mutable string to an immutable string.

                                        *place-channel-get*
(place-channel-get pch) -> place-message-allowed? ~
  pch : place-channel? ~

Returns a message received on channel pch, blocking until a message is
available.

                                        *place-channel-put/get*
(place-channel-put/get pch v) -> any/c ~
  pch : place-channel? ~
  v : any/c ~

Sends an immutable message v on channel pch and then waits for a message
(perhaps a reply) on the same channel.

                                        *place-message-allowed?*
(place-message-allowed? v) -> boolean? ~
  v : any/c ~

Returns #t if v is allowed as a message on a place channel, #f
otherwise.

If (place-enabled?) returns #f, then the result is always #t and no
conversions are performed on v as a message. Otherwise, the following
kinds of data are allowed as messages:

* numbers, characters, booleans, keywords, and #<void>;

* symbols, where the eq?ness of uninterned symbols is preserved within a
  single message, but not across messages;

* strings and byte strings, where mutable strings and byte strings are
  automatically replaced by immutable variants;

* paths (for any platform);

* pairs, lists, vectors, and immutable prefab structures containing
  message-allowed values, where a mutable vector is automatically
  replaced by an immutable vector;

* hash tables where mutable hash tables are automatically replaced by
  immutable variants;

* place channels, where a place descriptor is automatically replaced by
  a plain place channel;

* file-stream ports and TCP ports, where the underlying representation
  (such as a file descriptor, socket, or handle) is duplicated and
  attached to a fresh port in the receiving place;

* C pointers as created or accessed via ffi/unsafe; and

* values produced by shared-flvector, make-shared-flvector,
  shared-fxvector, make-shared-fxvector, shared-bytes, and
  make-shared-bytes.

prop:place-location : struct-type-property? ~
(place-location? v) -> boolean?
  v : any/c ~

A structure type property and associated predicate for implementations
of place locations. The value of prop:place-location must be a procedure
of four arguments: the place location itself, a module path, a symbol
for the start function exported by the module, and a place name (which
can be #f for an anonymous place).

A place location can be passed as the #:at argument to dynamic-place,
which in turn simply calls the prop:place-location value of the place
location.

A distributed places note created with create-place-node is an example
of a place location.

2. Places Logging

Place events are reported to a logger named 'place. In addition to its
string message, each event logged for a place has a data value that is
an instance of a place-event prefab structure:

  (struct place-event (place-id action value time)
    #:prefab) ~

The place-id field is an exact integer that identifies a place.

The time field is an inexact number that represents time in the same way
as current-inexact-milliseconds.

The action field is a symbol:

* 'create: a place was created. This event is logged in the creating
  place, and the event’s value field has the ID for the created place.

* 'reap: a place that was previously created in the current place has
  exited (and that fact has been detected, possibly via place-wait). The
  event’s value field has the ID for the exited place.

* 'enter: a place has started, logged within the started place. The
  event’s value field has #f.

* 'exit: a place is exiting, logged within the exiting place. The
  event’s value field has #f.

* 'put: a place-channel message has been sent. The event’s value field
  is a positive exact integer that approximates the message’s size.

* 'get: a place-channel message has been received. The event’s value
  field is a positive exact integer that approximates the message’s
  size.

Changed in version 6.0.0.2 of package base: Added logging via 'place and
place-event.
