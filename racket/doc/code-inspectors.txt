Code Inspectors

In the same way that inspectors control access to structure fields (see
[missing]), inspectors also control access to module bindings. The
default inspector for module bindings is determined by the
current-code-inspector parameter, instead of the current-inspector
parameter.

When a module declaration is evaluated, the value of the
current-code-inspector parameter is associated with the module
declaration. When the module is invoked via require or dynamic-require,
a sub-inspector of the module’s declaration-time inspector is created,
and this sub-inspector is associated with the module invocation. Any
inspector that controls the sub-inspector (including the
declaration-time inspector and its superior) controls the module
invocation. In particular, if the value of current-code-inspector never
changes, then no control is lost for any module invocation, since the
module’s invocation is associated with a sub-inspector of
current-code-inspector.

When an inspector that controls a module invocation is installed
current-code-inspector, it enables the following module->namespace on
the module, and it enables access to the module’s protected exports
(i.e., those identifiers exported from the module with protect-out) via
dynamic-require.

When a module form is expanded or a namespace is created, the value of
current-code-inspector is associated with the module or namespace’s
top-level lexical information. Syntax objects with that lexical
information gain access to the protected and unexported bindings of any
module that the inspector controls. In the case of a module, the
inspector sticks with such syntax objects even the syntax object is used
in the expansion of code in a less powerful context; furthermore, if the
syntax object is an identifier that is compiled as a variable reference,
the inspector sticks with the variable reference even if it appears in a
module form that is evaluated (i.e., declared) with a weaker inspector.
When a syntax object or variable reference is within compiled code that
is printed (see [missing]), the associated inspector is not preserved.

When compiled code in printed form is read back in, no inspectors are
associated with the code. When the code is evaluated, the instantiated
syntax-object literals and module-variable references acquire value of
current-code-inspector as their inspector.

When a module instantiation is attached to multiple namespaces, each
with its own module registry, the inspector for the module invocation
can be registry-specific. The invocation inspector in a particular
module registry can be changed via namespace-unprotect-module (but
changing the inspector requires control over the old one).

                                        *current-code-inspector*
(current-code-inspector) -> inspector? ~
(current-code-inspector insp) -> void?
  insp : inspector? ~

A parameter that determines an inspector to control access to module
bindings and redefinitions.
